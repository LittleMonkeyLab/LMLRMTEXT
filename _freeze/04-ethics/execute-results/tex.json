The researchers claimed to have shown a\nstatistical relationship between receiving the combined measles, mumps,\nand rubella (MMR) vaccine and the development of autism---suggesting\nfurthermore that the vaccine might even cause autism. One result of this\nreport was that many parents decided not to have their children\nvaccinated, which of course put them at higher risk for measles, mumps,\nand rubella. However, follow-up studies by other researchers\nconsistently failed to find a statistical relationship between the MMR\nvaccine and autism---and it is generally accepted now that there is no\nrelationship. In addition, several more serious problems with the\noriginal research were uncovered. Among them were that the lead\nresearcher stood to gain financially from his conclusions because he had\npatented a competing measles vaccine. He had also used biased methods to\nselect and test his research participants and had used unapproved and\nmedically unnecessary procedures on them. In 2010 The Lancet retracted\nthe article, and the lead researcher's right to practice medicine was\nrevoked [@burns2010british].\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![In 1998 a study linking the MMR vaccine to autism caused vaccination rates to drop and put children at higher risk of measles, mumps, and rubella.

We begin with a general framework for thinking about the\nethics of scientific research in psychology. Then we look at some\nspecific ethical codes for biomedical and behavioral\nresearchers---focusing on the Ethics Code of the American Psychological\nAssociation. Finally, we consider some practical tips for conducting\nethical research in psychology.\n\n## Moral Foundations of Ethical Research\n\n::: learningobjectives\n##### LEARNING OBJECTIVES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Describe a simple framework for thinking about ethical issues in\n    psychological research.\n2.  Give examples of several ethical issues that arise in psychological\n    research---including ones that affect research participants, the\n    scientific community, and society more generally.\n:::\n\n[Ethics] is the branch of philosophy that is concerned with\nmorality---what it means to behave morally and how people can achieve\nthat goal. It can also refer to a set of principles and practices that\nprovide moral guidance in a particular field. There is an ethics of\nbusiness, medicine, teaching, and of course, scientific research. As the\nopening example illustrates, many kinds of ethical issues can arise in\nscientific research, especially when it involves human participants. For\nthis reason, it is useful to begin with a general framework for thinking\nthrough these issues.\n\n### A Framework for Thinking About Research Ethics {.unnumbered}\n\nTable \\@ref(tab:ethics) presents a framework for thinking through the\nethical issues involved in psychological research. The rows of Table\n\\@ref(tab:ethics) represent four general moral principles that apply to\nscientific research: weighing risks against benefits, acting responsibly\nand with integrity, seeking justice, and respecting people's rights and\ndignity. (These principles are adapted from those in the American\nPsychological Association \\[APA\\] Ethics Code.) The columns of Table\n\\@ref(tab:ethics) represent three groups of people that are affected by\nscientific research: the research participants, the scientific\ncommunity, and society more generally. The idea is that a thorough\nconsideration of the ethics of any research project must take into\naccount how each of the four moral principles applies to each of the\nthree groups of people.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nTable: A framework for thinking about ethical issues in scientific research\n\n|Moral principle                        |Research participants |Scientific community |Society |\n|:--------------------------------------|:---------------------|:--------------------|:-------|\n|Weighing risks against benefits        |                      |                     |        |\n|Acting responsibly and with integrity  |                      |                     |        |\n|Seeking justice                        |                      |                     |        |\n|Respecting people’s rights and dignity |                      |                     |        |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Moral Principles {.unnumbered}\n\nLet us look more closely at each of the moral principles and how they\ncan be applied to each of the three groups.\n\n#### Weighing Risks Against Benefits {.unnumbered}\n\nScientific research in psychology can be ethical only if its risks are\noutweighed by its benefits. Among the risks to research participants are\nthat a treatment might fail to help or even be harmful, a procedure\nmight result in physical or psychological harm, and their right to\nprivacy might be violated. Among the potential benefits are receiving a\nhelpful treatment, learning about psychology, experiencing the\nsatisfaction of contributing to scientific knowledge, and receiving\nmoney or course credit for participating. Scientific research can have\nrisks and benefits to the scientific community and to society too\n[@rosenthal1994science]. A risk to science is that if a research\nquestion is uninteresting or a study is poorly designed, then the time,\nmoney, and effort spent on that research could have been spent on more\nproductive research. A risk to society is that research results could be\nmisunderstood or misapplied with harmful consequences. The research that\nmistakenly linked the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to\nautism resulted in both of these kinds of harm. Of course, the benefits\nof scientific research to science and society are that it advances\nscientific knowledge and can contribute to the welfare of society.\n\nIt is not necessarily easy to weigh the risks of research against its\nbenefits because the risks and benefits may not be directly comparable.\nFor example, it is common for the risks of a study to be primarily to\nthe research participants but the benefits primarily for science or\nsociety. Consider, for example, Stanley Milgram's original study on\nobedience to authority [@milgram1963behavioral]. The participants were\ntold that they were taking part in a study on the effects of punishment\non learning and were instructed to give electric shocks to another\nparticipant each time that participant responded incorrectly on a\nlearning task. With each incorrect response, the shock became\nstronger---eventually causing the other participant (who was in the next\nroom) to protest, complain about his heart, scream in pain, and finally\nfall silent and stop responding. If the first participant hesitated or\nexpressed concern, the researcher said that he must continue. In\nreality, the other participant was a [confederate] of the researcher---a\nhelper who pretended to be a real participant---and the protests,\ncomplaints, and screams that the real participant heard were an audio\nrecording that was activated when he flipped the switch to administer\nthe \"shocks.\" The surprising result of this study was that most of the\nreal participants continued to administer the shocks right through the\nconfederate's protests, complaints, and screams. Although this is\nconsidered one of the most important results in psychology---with\nimplications for understanding events like the Holocaust or the\nmistreatment of prisoners by US soldiers at Abu Ghraib---it came at the\ncost of producing severe psychological stress in the research\nparticipants.\n\n::: fyi\n##### Was It Worth It? {.unnumbered}\n\nMuch of the debate over the ethics of Milgram's obedience study concerns\nthe question of whether the resulting scientific knowledge was worth the\nharm caused to the research participants. To get a better sense of the\nharm, consider Milgram's own description of it.\n\n> In a large number of cases, the degree of tension reached extremes\n> that are rarely seen in sociopsychological laboratory studies.\n> Subjects were observed to sweat, tremble, stutter, bite their lips,\n> groan, and dig their fingernails into their flesh....Fourteen of the\n> 40 subjects showed definite signs of nervous laughter and smiling. The\n> laughter seemed entirely out of place, even bizarre. Full blown\n> uncontrollable seizures \\[of laughter\\] were observed for three\n> subjects. On one occasion we observed a seizure so violently\n> convulsive that it was necessary to call a halt to the experiment (p.\n> 375).\n\nMilgram also noted that another observer reported that within 20 minutes\none participant \"was reduced to a twitching, stuttering wreck, who was\nrapidly approaching the point of nervous collapse\" (p. 377)\n\nTo Milgram's credit, he went to great lengths to debrief his\nparticipants---including returning their mental states to normal---and\nto show that most of them thought the research was valuable and were\nglad to have participated. Still, this research would be considered\nunethical by today's standards.\n:::\n\n#### Acting Responsibly and With Integrity {.unnumbered}\n\nResearchers must act responsibly and with integrity. This means carrying\nout their research in a thorough and competent manner, meeting their\nprofessional obligations, and being truthful. Acting with integrity is\nimportant because it promotes trust, which is an essential element of\nall effective human relationships. Participants must be able to trust\nthat researchers are being honest with them (e.g., about what the study\ninvolves), will keep their promises (e.g., to maintain confidentiality),\nand will carry out their research in ways that maximize benefits and\nminimize risk. An important issue here is the use of deception. Some\nresearch questions (such as Milgram's) are difficult or impossible to\nanswer without deceiving research participants. Thus acting with\nintegrity can conflict with doing research that advances scientific\nknowledge and benefits society. We will consider how psychologists\ngenerally deal with this conflict shortly.\n\nThe scientific community and society must also be able to trust that\nresearchers have conducted their research thoroughly and competently and\nthat they have reported on it honestly. Again, the example at the\nbeginning of the chapter illustrates what can happen when this trust is\nviolated. In this case, other researchers wasted resources on\nunnecessary follow-up research and people avoided the MMR vaccine,\nputting their children at increased risk of measles, mumps, and rubella.\n\n#### Seeking Justice {.unnumbered}\n\nResearchers must conduct their research in a just manner. They should\ntreat their participants fairly, for example, by giving them adequate\ncompensation for their participation and making sure that benefits and\nrisks are distributed across all participants. For example, in a study\nof a new and potentially beneficial psychotherapy, some participants\nmight receive the psychotherapy while others serve as a control group\nthat receives no treatment. If the psychotherapy turns out to be\neffective, it would be fair to offer it to participants in the control\ngroup when the study ends.\n\nAt a broader societal level, members of some groups have historically\nfaced more than their fair share of the risks of scientific research,\nincluding people who are institutionalized, are disabled, or belong to\nracial or ethnic minorities. A particularly tragic example is the\nTuskegee syphilis study conducted by the US Public Health Service from\n1932 to 1972 [@reverby2009examining]. The participants in this study\nwere poor African American men in the vicinity of Tuskegee, Alabama, who\nwere told that they were being treated for \"bad blood.\" Although they\nwere given some free medical care, they were not treated for their\nsyphilis. Instead, they were observed to see how the disease developed\nin untreated patients. Even after the use of penicillin became the\nstandard treatment for syphilis in the 1940s, these men continued to be\ndenied treatment without being given an opportunity to leave the study.\nThe study was eventually discontinued only after details were made known\nto the general public by journalists and activists. It is now widely\nrecognized that researchers need to consider issues of justice and\nfairness at the societal level.\n\n::: fyi\n##### \"They Were Betrayed\" {.unnumbered}\n\nIn 1997---65 years after the Tuskegee Syphilis Study began and 25 years\nafter it ended---President Bill Clinton formally apologized on behalf of\nthe US government to those who were affected. Here is an excerpt from\nthe apology:\n\n> So today America does remember the hundreds of men used in research\n> without their knowledge and consent. We remember them and their family\n> members. Men who were poor and African American, without resources and\n> with few alternatives, they believed they had found hope when they\n> were offered free medical care by the United States Public Health\n> Service. They were betrayed.\n\nRead the [full text of the\napology](https://clintonwhitehouse4.archives.gov/textonly/New/Remarks/Fri/19970516-898.html).\n:::\n\n#### Respecting People's Rights and Dignity {.unnumbered}\n\nResearchers must respect people's rights and dignity as human beings.\nOne element of this is respecting their [autonomy]---their right to make\ntheir own choices and take their own actions free from coercion. Of\nfundamental importance here is the concept of [informed consent]. This\nmeans that researchers obtain and document people's agreement to\nparticipate in a study after having informed them of everything that\nmight reasonably be expected to affect their decision. Consider the\nparticipants in the Tuskegee study. Although they agreed to participate\nin the study, they were not told that they had syphilis but would be\ndenied treatment for it. Had they been told this basic fact about the\nstudy, it seems likely that they would not have agreed to participate.\nLikewise, had participants in Milgram's study been told that they might\nbe \"reduced to a twitching, stuttering wreck,\" it seems likely that many\nof them would not have agreed to participate. In neither of these\nstudies did participants give true informed consent.\n\nAnother element of respecting people's rights and dignity is respecting\ntheir [privacy]---their right to decide what information about them is\nshared with others. This means that researchers must maintain\n[confidentiality], which is essentially an agreement not to disclose\nparticipants' personal information without their consent or some\nappropriate legal authorization.\n\n### Unavoidable Ethical Conflict {.unnumbered}\n\nIt may already be clear that ethical conflict in psychological research\nis unavoidable. Because there is little, if any, psychological research\nthat is completely risk free, there will almost always be conflict\nbetween risks and benefits. Research that is beneficial to one group\n(e.g., the scientific community) can be harmful to another (e.g., the\nresearch participants), creating especially difficult tradeoffs. We have\nalso seen that being completely truthful with research participants can\nmake it difficult or impossible to conduct scientifically valid studies\non important questions.\n\nOf course, many ethical conflicts are fairly easy to resolve. Nearly\neveryone would agree that deceiving research participants and then\nsubjecting them to physical harm would not be justified by filling a\nsmall gap in the research literature. But many ethical conflicts are not\neasy to resolve, and competent and well-meaning researchers can disagree\nabout how to resolve them. Consider, for example, an actual study on\n\"personal space\" conducted in a public men's room\n[@middlemist1976personal]. The researchers secretly observed their\nparticipants to see whether it took them longer to begin urinating when\nthere was another man (a confederate of the researchers) at a nearby\nurinal. While some critics found this to be an unjustified assault on\nhuman dignity [@koocher1977bathroom], the researchers had carefully\nconsidered the ethical conflicts, resolved them as best they could, and\nconcluded that the benefits of the research outweighed the risks\n[@middlemist1977and]. For example, they had interviewed some preliminary\nparticipants and found that none of them was bothered by the fact that\nthey had been observed.\n\nThe point here is that although it may not be possible to eliminate\nethical conflict completely, it is possible to deal with it in\nresponsible and constructive ways. In general, this means thoroughly and\ncarefully thinking through the ethical issues that are raised,\nminimizing the risks, and weighing the risks against the benefits. It\nalso means being able to explain one's ethical decisions to others,\nseeking feedback on them, and ultimately taking responsibility for them.\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   A wide variety of ethical issues arise in psychological research.\n    Thinking them through requires considering how each of four moral\n    principles (weighing risks against benefits, acting responsibly and\n    with integrity, seeking justice, and respecting people's rights and\n    dignity) applies to each of three groups of people (research\n    participants, science, and society).\n-   Ethical conflict in psychological research is unavoidable.\n    Researchers must think through the ethical issues raised by their\n    research, minimize the risks, weigh the risks against the benefits,\n    be able to explain their ethical decisions, seek feedback about\n    these decisions from others, and ultimately take responsibility for\n    them.\n:::\n\n::: exercises\n##### EXERCISES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.

Describe the history of ethics codes for scientific research with\n    human participants.\n2.  Summarize the American Psychological Association Ethics\n    Code---especially as it relates to informed consent, deception,\n    debriefing, research with nonhuman animals, and scholarly integrity.\n:::\n\nThe general moral principles of weighing risks against benefits, acting\nwith integrity, seeking justice, and respecting people's rights and\ndignity provide a useful starting point for thinking about the ethics of\npsychological research because essentially everyone agrees on them. As\nwe have seen, however, even people who agree on these general principles\ncan disagree about specific ethical issues that arise in the course of\nconducting research. This is why there also exist more detailed and\nenforceable ethics codes that provide guidance on important issues that\narise frequently. In this section, we begin with a brief historical\noverview of such ethics codes and then look closely at the one that is\nmost relevant to psychological research---that of the American\nPsychological Association (APA).\n\n### Historical Overview {.unnumbered}\n\nOne of the earliest ethics codes was the [Nuremberg Code]---a set of 10\nprinciples written in 1947 in conjunction with the trials of Nazi\nphysicians accused of shockingly cruel research on concentration camp\nprisoners during World War II. It provided a standard against which to\ncompare the behavior of the men on trial---many of whom were eventually\nconvicted and either imprisoned or sentenced to death. The Nuremberg\nCode was particularly clear about the importance of carefully weighing\nrisks against benefits and the need for informed consent. The\n[Declaration of Helsinki] is a similar ethics code that was created by\nthe World Medical Council in 1964. Among the standards that it added to\nthe Nuremberg Code was that research with human participants should be\nbased on a written [protocol]---a detailed description of the\nresearch---that is reviewed by an independent committee. The Declaration\nof Helsinki has been revised several times, most recently in 2004.\n\nIn the United States, concerns about the Tuskegee study and others led\nto the publication in 1978 of a set of federal guidelines called the\n[Belmont Report]. The Belmont Report explicitly recognized the principle\nof seeking justice, including the importance of conducting research in a\nway that distributes risks and benefits fairly across different groups\nat the societal level. The Belmont Report became the basis of a set of\nlaws---the [Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects]---that\napply to research conducted, supported, or regulated by the federal\ngovernment. An extremely important part of these regulations is that\nuniversities, hospitals, and other institutions that receive support\nfrom the federal government must establish an [institutional review\nboard] (IRB)---a committee that is responsible for reviewing research\nprotocols for potential ethical problems. An IRB must consist of at\nleast five people with varying backgrounds, including members of\ndifferent professions, scientists and nonscientists, men and women, and\nat least one person not otherwise affiliated with the institution. The\nIRB helps to make sure that the risks of the proposed research are\nminimized, the benefits outweigh the risks, the research is carried out\nin a fair manner, and the informed consent procedure is adequate.\n\nThe federal regulations also distinguish research that poses three\nlevels of risk. [Exempt research] includes research on the effectiveness\nof normal educational activities, the use of standard psychological\nmeasures and surveys of a nonsensitive nature that are administered in a\nway that maintains confidentiality, and research using existing data\nfrom public sources. It is called exempt because the regulations do not\napply to it. [Minimal risk research] exposes participants to risks that\nare no greater than those encountered by healthy people in daily life or\nduring routine physical or psychological examinations. Minimal risk\nresearch can receive an expedited review by one member of the IRB or by\na separate committee under the authority of the IRB that can only\napprove minimal risk research. (Many departments of psychology have such\nseparate committees.) Finally, [at-risk research] poses greater than\nminimal risk and must be reviewed by the IRB.\n\n::: fyi\n##### Ethics Codes {.unnumbered}\n\n[This\npage](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/international/ethical-codes-and-research-standards/index.html)\nfrom the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services allows you to read\nthe ethics codes discussed in this section in their entirety. They are\nall highly recommended and, with the exception of the Federal Policy,\nshort and easy to read.\n\n-   The Nuremberg Code\n-   The Declaration of Helsinki\n-   The Belmont Report\n-   Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects\n:::\n\n### APA Ethics Code {.unnumbered}\n\nThe APA's *Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct*\n(also known as the [APA Ethics Code]) was first published in 1953 and\nhas been revised several times since then, most recently in 2002. It\nincludes about 150 specific ethical standards that psychologists and\ntheir students are expected to follow. Much of the APA Ethics Code\nconcerns the clinical practice of psychology---advertising one's\nservices, setting and collecting fees, having personal relationships\nwith clients, and so on. For our purposes, the most relevant part is\n*Standard 8: Research and Publication*. Although *Standard 8* is\nreproduced here in its entirety, we should consider some of its most\nimportant aspects---informed consent, deception, debriefing, the use of\nnonhuman animal subjects, and scholarly integrity---in more detail.\n\n::: fyi\n##### APA Ethics Code {.unnumbered}\n\nStandard 8: Research and Publication\n\n**8.01 Institutional Approval**\n\nWhen institutional approval is required, psychologists provide accurate\ninformation about their research proposals and obtain approval prior to\nconducting the research. They conduct the research in accordance with\nthe approved research protocol.\n\n**8.02 Informed Consent to Research**\n\n(a) When obtaining informed consent as required in Standard 3.10,\n    Informed Consent, psychologists inform participants about (1) the\n    purpose of the research, expected duration, and procedures; (2)\n    their right to decline to participate and to withdraw from the\n    research once participation has begun; (3) the foreseeable\n    consequences of declining or withdrawing; (4) reasonably foreseeable\n    factors that may be expected to influence their willingness to\n    participate such as potential risks, discomfort, or adverse\n    effects; (5) any prospective research benefits; (6) limits of\n    confidentiality; (7) incentives for participation; and (8) whom to\n    contact for questions about the research and research participants'\n    rights. They provide opportunity for the prospective participants to\n    ask questions and receive answers. (See also Standards 8.03,\n    Informed Consent for Recording Voices and Images in Research ; 8.05,\n    Dispensing with Informed Consent for Research ; and 8.07, Deception\n    in Research .)\n\n(b) Psychologists conducting intervention research involving the use of\n    experimental treatments clarify to participants at the outset of the\n    research (1) the experimental nature of the treatment; (2) the\n    services that will or will not be available to the control group(s)\n    if appropriate; (3) the means by which assignment to treatment and\n    control groups will be made; (4) available treatment alternatives if\n    an individual does not wish to participate in the research or wishes\n    to withdraw once a study has begun; and (5) compensation for or\n    monetary costs of participating including, if appropriate, whether\n    reimbursement from the participant or a third-party payor will be\n    sought. (See also Standard 8.02a, Informed Consent to Research .)\n\n**8.03 Informed Consent for Recording Voices and Images in Research**\n\nPsychologists obtain informed consent from research participants prior\nto recording their voices or images for data collection unless (1) the\nresearch consists solely of naturalistic observations in public places,\nand it is not anticipated that the recording will be used in a manner\nthat could cause personal identification or harm, or (2) the research\ndesign includes deception, and consent for the use of the recording is\nobtained during debriefing. (See also Standard 8.07, Deception in\nResearch .)\n\n**8.04 Client/Patient, Student, and Subordinate Research Participants**\n\n(a) When psychologists conduct research with clients/patients, students,\n    or subordinates as participants, psychologists take steps to protect\n    the prospective participants from adverse consequences of declining\n    or withdrawing from participation.\n\n(b) When research participation is a course requirement or an\n    opportunity for extra credit, the prospective participant is given\n    the choice of equitable alternative activities.\n\n**8.05 Dispensing With Informed Consent for Research**\n\nPsychologists may dispense with informed consent only (1) where research\nwould not reasonably be assumed to create distress or harm and involves\n(a) the study of normal educational practices, curricula, or classroom\nmanagement methods conducted in educational settings; (b) only anonymous\nquestionnaires, naturalistic observations, or archival research for\nwhich disclosure of responses would not place participants at risk of\ncriminal or civil liability or damage their financial standing,\nemployability, or reputation, and confidentiality is protected; or (c)\nthe study of factors related to job or organization effectiveness\nconducted in organizational settings for which there is no risk to\nparticipants' employability, and confidentiality is protected or (2)\nwhere otherwise permitted by law or federal or institutional\nregulations.\n\n**8.06 Offering Inducements for Research Participation**\n\n(a) Psychologists make reasonable efforts to avoid offering excessive or\n    inappropriate financial or other inducements for research\n    participation when such inducements are likely to coerce\n    participation.\n\n(b) When offering professional services as an inducement for research\n    participation, psychologists clarify the nature of the services, as\n    well as the risks, obligations, and limitations. (See also Standard\n    6.05, Barter with Clients/Patients .)\n\n**8.07 Deception in Research**\n\n(a) Psychologists do not conduct a study involving deception unless they\n    have determined that the use of deceptive techniques is justified by\n    the study's significant prospective scientific, educational, or\n    applied value and that effective nondeceptive alternative procedures\n    are not feasible.\n\n(b) Psychologists do not deceive prospective participants about research\n    that is reasonably expected to cause physical pain or severe\n    emotional distress.\n\n(c) Psychologists explain any deception that is an integral feature of\n    the design and conduct of an experiment to participants as early as\n    is feasible, preferably at the conclusion of their participation,\n    but no later than at the conclusion of the data collection, and\n    permit participants to withdraw their data. (See also Standard 8.08,\n    Debriefing .)\n\n**8.08 Debriefing**\n\n(a) Psychologists provide a prompt opportunity for participants to\n    obtain appropriate information about the nature, results, and\n    conclusions of the research, and they take reasonable steps to\n    correct any misconceptions that participants may have of which the\n    psychologists are aware.\n\n(b) If scientific or humane values justify delaying or withholding this\n    information, psychologists take reasonable measures to reduce the\n    risk of harm.\n\n(c) When psychologists become aware that research procedures have harmed\n    a participant, they take reasonable steps to minimize the harm.\n\n**8.09 Humane Care and Use of Animals in Research**\n\n(a) Psychologists acquire, care for, use, and dispose of animals in\n    compliance with current federal, state, and local laws and\n    regulations, and with professional standards.\n\n(b) Psychologists trained in research methods and experienced in the\n    care of laboratory animals supervise all procedures involving\n    animals and are responsible for ensuring appropriate consideration\n    of their comfort, health, and humane treatment.\n\n(c) Psychologists ensure that all individuals under their supervision\n    who are using animals have received instruction in research methods\n    and in the care, maintenance, and handling of the species being\n    used, to the extent appropriate to their role. (See also Standard\n    2.05, Delegation of Work to Others .)\n\n(d) Psychologists make reasonable efforts to minimize the discomfort,\n    infection, illness, and pain of animal subjects.\n\n(e) Psychologists use a procedure subjecting animals to pain, stress, or\n    privation only when an alternative procedure is unavailable and the\n    goal is justified by its prospective scientific, educational, or\n    applied value.\n\n(f) Psychologists perform surgical procedures under appropriate\n    anesthesia and follow techniques to avoid infection and minimize\n    pain during and after surgery.\n\n(g) When it is appropriate that an animal's life be terminated,\n    psychologists proceed rapidly, with an effort to minimize pain and\n    in accordance with accepted procedures.\n\n**8.10 Reporting Research Results**\n\n(a) Psychologists do not fabricate data. (See also Standard 5.01a,\n    Avoidance of False or Deceptive Statements .)\n\n(b) If psychologists discover significant errors in their published\n    data, they take reasonable steps to correct such errors in a\n    correction, retraction, erratum, or other appropriate publication\n    means.\n\n**8.11 Plagiarism**\n\nPsychologists do not present portions of another's work or data as their\nown, even if the other work or data source is cited occasionally.\n\n**8.12 Publication Credit**\n\n(a) Psychologists take responsibility and credit, including authorship\n    credit, only for work they have actually performed or to which they\n    have substantially contributed. (See also Standard 8.12b,\n    Publication Credit .)\n\n(b) Principal authorship and other publication credits accurately\n    reflect the relative scientific or professional contributions of the\n    individuals involved, regardless of their relative status. Mere\n    possession of an institutional position, such as department chair,\n    does not justify authorship credit. Minor contributions to the\n    research or to the writing for publications are acknowledged\n    appropriately, such as in footnotes or in an introductory statement.\n\n(c) Except under exceptional circumstances, a student is listed as\n    principal author on any multiple-authored article that is\n    substantially based on the student's doctoral dissertation. Faculty\n    advisors discuss publication credit with students as early as\n    feasible and throughout the research and publication process as\n    appropriate. (See also Standard 8.12b, Publication Credit .)\n\n**8.13 Duplicate Publication of Data**\n\nPsychologists do not publish, as original data, data that have been\npreviously published. This does not preclude republishing data when they\nare accompanied by proper acknowledgment.\n\n**8.14 Sharing Research Data for Verification**\n\n(a) After research results are published, psychologists do not withhold\n    the data on which their conclusions are based from other competent\n    professionals who seek to verify the substantive claims through\n    reanalysis and who intend to use such data only for that purpose,\n    provided that the confidentiality of the participants can be\n    protected and unless legal rights concerning proprietary data\n    preclude their release.

Again, informed\nconsent means obtaining and documenting people's agreement to\nparticipate in a study, having informed them of everything that might\nreasonably be expected to affect their decision. This includes details\nof the procedure, the risks and benefits of the research, the fact that\nthey have the right to decline to participate or to withdraw from the\nstudy, the consequences of doing so, and any legal limits to\nconfidentiality. For example, some states require researchers who learn\nof child abuse or other crimes to report this information to\nauthorities.\n\nAlthough the process of obtaining informed consent often involves having\nparticipants read and sign a [consent form], it is important to\nunderstand that this is not all it is. Although having participants read\nand sign a consent form might be enough when they are competent adults\nwith the necessary ability and motivation, many participants do not\nactually read consent forms or read them but do not understand them. For\nexample, participants often mistake consent forms for legal documents\nand mistakenly believe that by signing them they give up their right to\nsue the researcher [@mann1994informed]. Even with competent adults,\ntherefore, it is good practice to tell participants about the risks and\nbenefits, demonstrate the procedure, ask them if they have questions,\nand remind them of their right to withdraw at any time---in addition to\nhaving them read and sign a consent form.\n\nNote also that there are situations in which informed consent is not\nnecessary. These include situations in which the research is not\nexpected to cause any harm and the procedure is straightforward or the\nstudy is conducted in the context of people's ordinary activities. For\nexample, if you wanted to sit outside a public building and observe\nwhether people hold the door open for people behind them, you would not\nneed to obtain their informed consent. Similarly, if a college\ninstructor wanted to compare two legitimate teaching methods across two\nsections of his research methods course, he would not need to obtain\ninformed consent from his students.\n\n#### Deception {.unnumbered}\n\n[Deception] of participants in psychological research can take a variety\nof forms: misinforming participants about the purpose of a study, using\nconfederates, using phony equipment like Milgram's shock generator, and\npresenting participants with false feedback about their performance\n(e.g., telling them they did poorly on a test when they actually did\nwell). Deception also includes not informing participants of the full\ndesign or true purpose of the research even if they are not actively\nmisinformed [@sieber1995deception]. For example, a study on incidental\nlearning---learning without conscious effort---might involve having\nparticipants read through a list of words in preparation for a \"memory\ntest\" later. Although participants are likely to assume that the memory\ntest will require them to recall the words, it might instead require\nthem to recall the contents of the room or the appearance of the\nresearch assistant.\n\nSome researchers have argued that deception of research participants is\nrarely if ever ethically justified. Among their arguments are that it\nprevents participants from giving truly informed consent, fails to\nrespect their dignity as human beings, has the potential to upset them,\nmakes them distrustful and therefore less honest in their responding,\nand damages the reputation of researchers in the field\n[@baumrind1985research].\n\nNote, however, that the APA Ethics Code takes a more moderate\napproach---allowing deception when the benefits of the study outweigh\nthe risks, participants cannot reasonably be expected to be harmed, the\nresearch question cannot be answered without the use of deception, and\nparticipants are informed about the deception as soon as possible. This\napproach acknowledges that not all forms of deception are equally bad.\nCompare, for example, Milgram's study in which he deceived his\nparticipants in several significant ways that resulted in their\nexperiencing severe psychological stress with an incidental learning\nstudy in which a \"memory test\" turns out to be slightly different from\nwhat participants were expecting. It also acknowledges that some\nscientifically and socially important research questions can be\ndifficult or impossible to answer without deceiving participants.\nKnowing that a study concerns the extent to which they obey authority,\nact aggressively toward a peer, or help a stranger is likely to change\nthe way people behave so that the results no longer generalize to the\nreal world.\n\n#### Debriefing {.unnumbered}\n\nStandard 8.08 is about [debriefing]. This is the process of informing\nresearch participants as soon as possible of the purpose of the study,\nrevealing any deception, and correcting any other misconceptions they\nmight have as a result of participating. Debriefing also involves\nminimizing harm that might have occurred. For example, an experiment on\nthe effects of being in a sad mood on memory might involve inducing a\nsad mood in participants by having them think sad thoughts, watch a sad\nvideo, or listen to sad music. Debriefing would be the time to return\nparticipants' moods to normal by having them think happy thoughts, watch\na happy video, or listen to happy music.\n\n#### Nonhuman Animal Subjects {.unnumbered}\n\nStandard 8.09 is about the humane treatment and care of nonhuman animal\nsubjects. Although most contemporary research in psychology does not\ninvolve nonhuman animal subjects, a significant minority of it\ndoes---especially in the study of learning and conditioning, behavioral\nneuroscience, and the development of drug and surgical therapies for\npsychological disorders.\n\nThe use of nonhuman animal subjects in psychological research is like\nthe use of deception in that there are those who argue that it is\nrarely, if ever, ethically acceptable [@bowd1993case]. Clearly, nonhuman\nanimals are incapable of giving informed consent. Yet they can be\nsubjected to numerous procedures that are likely to cause them\nsuffering. They can be confined, deprived of food and water, subjected\nto pain, operated on, and ultimately euthanized. (Of course, they can\nalso be observed benignly in natural or zoolike settings.) Others point\nout that psychological research on nonhuman animals has resulted in many\nimportant benefits to humans, including the development of behavioral\ntherapies for many disorders, more effective pain control methods, and\nantipsychotic drugs [@miller1985value]. It has also resulted in benefits\nto nonhuman animals, including alternatives to shooting and poisoning as\nmeans of controlling them.\n\nAs with deception, the APA acknowledges that the benefits of research on\nnonhuman animals can outweigh the costs, in which case it is ethically\nacceptable. However, researchers must use alternative methods when they\ncan. When they cannot, they must acquire and care for their subjects\nhumanely and minimize the harm to them. For more information on the\nAPA's position on nonhuman animal subjects, see the website of the APA's\nCommittee on Animal Research and Ethics\n(http://www.apa.org/science/leadership/care/index.aspx).\n\n#### Scholarly Integrity {.unnumbered}\n\nStandards 8.10 to 8.15 are about scholarly integrity. These include the\nobvious points that researchers must not fabricate data or plagiarize.\nPlagiarism means using others' words or ideas without proper\nacknowledgment. Proper acknowledgment generally means indicating direct\nquotations with quotation marks and providing a citation to the source\nof any quotation or idea used.\n\nThe remaining standards make some less obvious but equally important\npoints. Researchers should not publish the same data a second time as\nthough it were new, they should share their data with other researchers,\nand as peer reviewers they should keep the unpublished research they\nreview confidential. Note that the authors' names on published\nresearch---and the order in which those names appear---should reflect\nthe importance of each person's contribution to the research. It would\nbe unethical, for example, to include as an author someone who had made\nonly minor contributions to the research (e.g., analyzing some of the\ndata) or for a faculty member to make himself or herself the first\nauthor on research that was largely conducted by a student.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![According to the APA Ethics Code, faculty advisers should discuss publication credit—who will be an author and the order of authors—with their student collaborators as early as possible in the research process. *Photo by Christina @ wocintechchat.com on Unsplash.*](images/ethics/authorship.jpeg){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   There are several written ethics codes for research with human\n    participants that provide specific guidance on the ethical issues\n    that arise most frequently. These codes include the Nuremberg Code,\n    the Declaration of Helsinki, the Belmont Report, and the Federal\n    Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects.\n-   The APA Ethics Code is the most important ethics code for\n    researchers in psychology. It includes many standards that are\n    relevant mainly to clinical practice, but Standard 8 concerns\n    informed consent, deception, debriefing, the use of nonhuman animal\n    subjects, and scholarly integrity in research.\n-   Research conducted at universities, hospitals, and other\n    institutions that receive support from the federal government must\n    be reviewed by an institutional review board (IRB)---a committee at\n    the institution that reviews research protocols to make sure they\n    conform to ethical standards.\n-   Informed consent is the process of obtaining and documenting\n    people's agreement to participate in a study, having informed them\n    of everything that might reasonably be expected to affect their\n    decision. Although it often involves having them read and sign a\n    consent form, it is not equivalent to reading and signing a consent\n    form.\n-   Although some researchers argue that deception of research\n    participants is never ethically justified, the APA Ethics Code\n    allows for its use when the benefits of using it outweigh the risks,\n    participants cannot reasonably be expected to be harmed, there is no\n    way to conduct the study without deception, and participants are\n    informed of the deception as soon as possible.\n:::\n\n::: exercises\n##### EXERCISES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.

Discussion: In a study on the effects of disgust on moral judgment,\n    participants were asked to judge the morality of disgusting acts,\n    including people eating a dead pet and passionate kissing between a\n    brother and sister [@haidt1993affect]. If you were on the IRB that\n    reviewed this protocol, what concerns would you have with it? Refer\n    to the appropriate sections of the APA Ethics Code.\n:::\n\n## Putting Ethics Into Practice\n\n::: learningobjectives\n##### LEARNING OBJECTIVES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Describe several strategies for identifying and minimizing risks and\n    deception in psychological research.\n2.  Create thorough informed consent and debriefing procedures,\n    including a consent form.\n:::\n\nIn this section, we look at some practical advice for conducting ethical\nresearch in psychology. Again, it is important to remember that ethical\nissues arise well before you begin to collect data and continue to arise\nthrough publication and beyond.\n\n### Know and Accept Your Ethical Responsibilities {.unnumbered}\n\nAs the American Psychological Association (APA) Ethics Code notes in its\nintroduction, \"Lack of awareness or misunderstanding of an ethical\nstandard is not itself a defense to a charge of unethical conduct.\" This\nis why the very first thing that you must do as a new researcher is know\nand accept your ethical responsibilities. At a minimum, this means\nreading and understanding the relevant standards of the APA Ethics Code,\ndistinguishing minimal risk from at-risk research, and knowing the\nspecific policies and procedures of your institution---including how to\nprepare and submit a research protocol for institutional review board\n(IRB) review. If you are conducting research as a course requirement,\nthere may be specific course standards, policies, and procedures. If any\nstandard, policy, or procedure is unclear---or you are unsure what to do\nabout an ethical issue that arises---you must seek clarification. You\ncan do this by reviewing the relevant ethics codes, reading about how\nsimilar issues have been resolved by others, or consulting with more\nexperienced researchers, your IRB, or your course instructor.\nUltimately, you as the researcher must take responsibility for the\nethics of the research you conduct.\n\n### Identify and Minimize Risks {.unnumbered}\n\nAs you design your study, you must identify and minimize risks to\nparticipants. Start by listing all the risks, including risks of\nphysical and psychological harm and violations of confidentiality.\nRemember that it is easy for researchers to see risks as less serious\nthan participants do or even to overlook them completely. For example,\none student researcher wanted to test people's sensitivity to violent\nimages by showing them gruesome photographs of crime and accident\nscenes. Because she was an emergency medical technician, however, she\ngreatly underestimated how disturbing these images were to most people.\nRemember too that some risks might apply only to some participants. For\nexample, while most people would have no problem completing a survey\nabout their fear of various crimes, those who have been a victim of one\nof those crimes might become upset. This is why you should seek input\nfrom a variety of people, including your research collaborators, more\nexperienced researchers, and even from nonresearchers who might be\nbetter able to take the perspective of a participant.\n\nOnce you have identified the risks, you can often reduce or eliminate\nmany of them. One way is to modify the research design. For example, you\nmight be able to shorten or simplify the procedure to prevent boredom\nand frustration. You might be able to replace upsetting or offensive\nstimulus materials (e.g., graphic accident scene photos) with less\nupsetting or offensive ones (e.g., milder photos of the sort people are\nlikely to see in the newspaper). A good example of modifying a research\ndesign is a 2009 replication of Milgram's study conducted by Jerry\nBurger. Instead of allowing his participants to continue administering\nshocks up to the 450-V maximum, the researcher always stopped the\nprocedure when they were about to administer the 150-V shock\n[@burger2009replicating]. This made sense because in Milgram's study (a)\nparticipants' severe negative reactions occurred after this point and\n(b) most participants who administered the 150-V shock continued all the\nway to the 450-V maximum. Thus the researcher was able to compare his\nresults directly with Milgram's at every point up to the 150-V shock and\nalso was able to estimate how many of his participants would have\ncontinued to the maximum---but without subjecting them to the severe\nstress that Milgram did. (The results, by the way, were that these\ncontemporary participants were just as obedient as Milgram's were.)\n\nA second way to minimize risks is to use a [prescreening] procedure to\nidentify and eliminate participants who are at high risk. You can do\nthis in part through the informed consent process. For example, you can\nwarn participants that a survey includes questions about their fear of\ncrime and remind them that they are free to withdraw if they think this\nmight upset them. Prescreening can also involve collecting data to\nidentify and eliminate participants. For example, Burger used an\nextensive prescreening procedure involving multiple questionnaires and\nan interview with a clinical psychologist to identify and eliminate\nparticipants with physical or psychological problems that put them at\nhigh risk.\n\nA third way to minimize risks is to take active steps to maintain\nconfidentiality. You should keep signed consent forms separately from\nany data that you collect and in such a way that no individual's name\ncan be linked to his or her data. In addition, beyond people's sex and\nage, you should only collect personal information that you actually need\nto answer your research question. If people's sexual orientation or\nethnicity is not clearly relevant to your research question, for\nexample, then do not ask them about it. Be aware also that certain data\ncollection procedures can lead to unintentional violations of\nconfidentiality. When participants respond to an oral survey in a\nshopping mall or complete a questionnaire in a classroom setting, it is\npossible that their responses will be overheard or seen by others. If\nthe responses are personal, it is better to administer the survey or\nquestionnaire individually in private or to use other techniques to\nprevent the unintentional sharing of personal information.\n\n### Identify and Minimize Deception {.unnumbered}\n\nRemember that deception can take a variety of forms, not all of which\ninvolve actively misleading participants. It is also deceptive to allow\nparticipants to make incorrect assumptions (e.g., about what will be on\na \"memory test\") or simply withhold information about the full design or\npurpose of the study. It is best to identify and minimize *all* forms of\ndeception.\n\nRemember that according to the APA Ethics Code, deception is ethically\nacceptable only if there is no way to answer your research question\nwithout it. Therefore, if your research design includes any form of\nactive deception, you should consider whether it is truly necessary.\nImagine, for example, that you want to know whether the age of college\nprofessors affects students' expectations about their teaching ability.\nYou could do this by telling participants that you will show them photos\nof college professors and ask them to rate each one's teaching ability.\nBut if the photos are not really of college professors but of your own\nfamily members and friends, then this would be deception. This deception\ncould easily be eliminated, however, by telling participants instead to\n*imagine* that the photos are of college professors and to rate them as\n*if* they were.\n\nIn general, it is considered acceptable to wait until debriefing before\nyou reveal your research question as long as you describe the procedure,\nrisks, and benefits during the informed consent process. For example,\nyou would not have to tell participants that you wanted to know whether\nthe age of college professors affects people's expectations about them\nuntil the study was over. Not only is this information unlikely to\naffect people's decision about whether or not to participate in the\nstudy, but it has the potential to invalidate the results. Participants\nwho know that age is the independent variable might rate the older and\nyounger \"professors\" differently because they think you want them to.\nAlternatively, they might be careful to rate them the same so that they\ndo not appear prejudiced. But even this extremely mild form of deception\ncan be minimized by informing participants---orally, in writing, or\nboth---that although you have accurately described the procedure, risks,\nand benefits, you will wait to reveal the research question until\nafterward. In essence, participants give their consent to be deceived or\nto have information withheld from them until later.\n\n### Weigh the Risks Against the Benefits {.unnumbered}\n\nOnce the risks of the research have been identified and minimized, you\nneed to weigh them against the benefits. This requires identifying all\nthe benefits. Remember to consider benefits to the research\nparticipants, to science, and to society. If you are a student\nresearcher, remember that one of the benefits is the knowledge you will\ngain about how to conduct scientific research in psychology---knowledge\nyou can then use to complete your studies and succeed in graduate school\nor in your career.\n\nIf the research poses minimal risk---no more than in people's daily\nlives or routine physical or psychological examinations---then even a\nsmall benefit to participants, science, or society is generally\nconsidered enough to justify it. If it poses more than minimal risk,\nthen there should be more benefits. If the research has the potential to\nupset some participants, for example, then it becomes more important\nthat the study be well designed and answer a scientifically interesting\nresearch question or have clear practical implications. It would be\nunethical to subject people to pain, fear, or embarrassment for no\nbetter reason than to satisfy one's personal curiosity. In general,\npsychological research that has the potential to cause harm that is more\nthan minor or lasts for more than a short time is rarely considered\njustified by its benefits. Consider, for example, that Milgram's\nstudy---as interesting and important as the results were---would be\nconsidered unethical by today's standards.\n\n### Create Informed Consent and Debriefing Procedures {.unnumbered}\n\nOnce you have settled on a research design, you need to create your\ninformed consent and debriefing procedures. Start by deciding whether\ninformed consent is necessary according to APA Standard 8.05. If\ninformed consent is necessary, there are several things you should do.\nFirst, when you recruit participants---whether it is through word of\nmouth, posted advertisements, or a participant pool---provide them with\nas much information about the study as you can. This will allow those\nwho might find the study objectionable to avoid it. Second, prepare a\nscript or set of \"talking points\" to help you explain the study to your\nparticipants in simple everyday language. This should include a\ndescription of the procedure, the risks and benefits, and their right to\nwithdraw at any time. Third, create an informed consent form that covers\nall the points in Standard 8.02a that participants can read and sign\nafter you have described the study to them. Your university, department,\nor course instructor may have a sample consent form that you can adapt\nfor your own study. If not, an Internet search will turn up several\nsamples. Remember that if appropriate, both the oral and written parts\nof the informed consent process should include the fact that you are\nkeeping some information about the design or purpose of the study from\nthem but that you will reveal it during debriefing.\n\nDebriefing is similar to informed consent in that you cannot necessarily\nexpect participants to read and understand written debriefing forms. So\nagain it is best to write a script or set of talking points with the\ngoal of being able to explain the study in simple everyday language.\nDuring debriefing, you should reveal the research question and full\ndesign of the study. For example, if participants are tested under only\none condition, then you should explain what happened in the other\nconditions. If you deceived your participants, you should reveal this as\nsoon as possible, apologize for the deception, explain why it was\nnecessary, and correct any misconceptions that participants might have\nas a result. Debriefing is also a good time to provide additional\nbenefits to research participants by giving them relevant practical\ninformation or referrals to other sources of help. For example, in a\nstudy of attitudes toward domestic abuse, you could provide pamphlets\nabout domestic abuse and referral information to the university\ncounseling center for those who might want it.\n\nRemember to schedule plenty of time for the informed consent and\ndebriefing processes. They cannot be effective if you have to rush\nthrough them.\n\n### Get Approval {.unnumbered}\n\nThe next step is to get institutional approval for your research based\non the specific policies and procedures at your institution or for your\ncourse. This will generally require writing a protocol that describes\nthe purpose of the study, the research design and procedure, the risks\nand benefits, the steps taken to minimize risks, and the informed\nconsent and debriefing procedures. Do not think of the institutional\napproval process as merely an obstacle to overcome but as an opportunity\nto think through the ethics of your research and to consult with others\nwho are likely to have more experience or different perspectives than\nyou. If the IRB has questions or concerns about your research, address\nthem promptly and in good faith. This might even mean making further\nmodifications to your research design and procedure before resubmitting\nyour protocol.\n\n### Follow Through {.unnumbered}\n\nYour concern with ethics should not end when your study receives\ninstitutional approval. It now becomes important to stick to the\nprotocol you submitted or to seek additional approval for anything other\nthan a minor change. During the research, you should monitor your\nparticipants for unanticipated reactions and seek feedback from them\nduring debriefing. One criticism of Milgram's study is that although he\ndid not know ahead of time that his participants would have such severe\nnegative reactions, he certainly knew after he had tested the first\nseveral participants and should have made adjustments at that point\n[@baumrind1985research]. Be alert also for potential violations of\nconfidentiality. Keep the consent forms and the data safe and separate\nfrom each other and make sure that no one, intentionally or\nunintentionally, has access to any participant's personal information.\n\nFinally, you must maintain your integrity through the publication\nprocess and beyond. Address publication credit---who will be authors on\nthe research and the order of authors---with your collaborators early\nand avoid plagiarism in your writing. Remember that your scientific goal\nis to learn about the way the world actually is and that your scientific\nduty is to report on your results honestly and accurately. So do not be\ntempted to fabricate data or alter your results in any way. Besides,\nunexpected results are often as interesting, or more so, than expected\nones.\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   It is your responsibility as a researcher to know and accept your\n    ethical responsibilities.\n-   You can take several concrete steps to minimize risks and deception\n    in your research.
