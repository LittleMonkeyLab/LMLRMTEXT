They conducted an experiment in which\nthey manipulated participants' feelings of disgust by testing them in\neither a clean room or a messy room that contained dirty dishes, an\noverflowing wastebasket, and a chewed-up pen. They also used a\nself-report questionnaire to measure the amount of attention that people\npay to their own bodily sensations. They called this \"private body\nconsciousness.\" They measured their primary dependent variable, the\nharshness of people's moral judgments, by describing different behaviors\n(e.g., eating one's dead dog, failing to return a found wallet) and\nhaving participants rate the moral acceptability of each one on a scale\nof 1 to 7. They also measured some other dependent variables, including\nparticipants' willingness to eat at a new restaurant. Finally, the\nresearchers asked participants to rate their current level of disgust\nand other emotions. The primary results of this study were that\nparticipants in the messy room were in fact more disgusted and made\nharsher moral judgments than participants in the clean room---but only\nif they scored relatively high in private body consciousness.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Research suggests that disgusting surroundings can cause people to make harsher moral judgments. *Photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash.*](images/complex-designs/garbage.jpeg){fig-align='center' width=40%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe research designs we have considered so far have been\nsimple---focusing on a question about one variable or about a\nstatistical relationship between two variables. But in many ways the\ncomplex design of the experiment undertaken by Schnall and her\ncolleagues is more typical of research in psychology. Fortunately, we\nhave already covered the basic elements of such designs in previous\nchapters. In this chapter, we look closely at how and why researchers\ncombine these basic elements into more complex designs. We start with\ncomplex experiments---considering first the inclusion of multiple\ndependent variables and then the inclusion of multiple independent\nvariables. Finally, we look at complex correlational designs.\n\n## Multiple Dependent Variables\n\n::: learningobjectives\n##### LEARNING OBJECTIVES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Explain why researchers often include multiple dependent variables\n    in their studies.\n2.  Explain what a manipulation check is and when it would be included\n    in an experiment.\n:::\n\nImagine that you have made the effort to find a research topic, review\nthe research literature, formulate a question, design an experiment,\nobtain institutional review board (IRB) approval, recruit research\nparticipants, and manipulate an independent variable. It would seem\nalmost wasteful to measure a single dependent variable. Even if you are\nprimarily interested in the relationship between an independent variable\nand one primary dependent variable, there are usually several more\nquestions that you can answer easily by including [multiple dependent\nvariables].\n\n### Measures of Different Constructs {.unnumbered}\n\nOften a researcher wants to know how an independent variable affects\nseveral distinct dependent variables. For example, Schnall and her\ncolleagues were interested in how feeling disgusted affects the\nharshness of people's moral judgments, but they were also curious about\nhow disgust affects other variables, such as people's willingness to eat\nin a restaurant. As another example, researcher Susan Knasko was\ninterested in how different odors affect people's behavior\n[@knasko1992ambient]. She conducted an experiment in which the\nindependent variable was whether participants were tested in a room with\nno odor or in one scented with lemon, lavender, or dimethyl sulfide\n(which has a cabbagelike smell). Although she was primarily interested\nin how the odors affected people's creativity, she was also curious\nabout how they affected people's moods and perceived health---and it was\na simple enough matter to measure these dependent variables too.\nAlthough she found that creativity was unaffected by the ambient odor,\nshe found that people's moods were lower in the dimethyl sulfide\ncondition, and that their perceived health was greater in the lemon\ncondition.\n\nWhen an experiment includes multiple dependent variables, there is again\na possibility of carryover effects. For example, it is possible that\nmeasuring participants' moods before measuring their perceived health\ncould affect their perceived health or that measuring their perceived\nhealth before their moods could affect their moods. So the order in\nwhich multiple dependent variables are measured becomes an issue. One\napproach is to measure them in the same order for all\nparticipants---usually with the most important one first so that it\ncannot be affected by measuring the others. Another approach is to\ncounterbalance, or systematically vary, the order in which the dependent\nvariables are measured.\n\n### Manipulation Checks {.unnumbered}\n\nWhen the independent variable is a construct that can only be\nmanipulated indirectly---such as emotions and other internal states---an\nadditional measure of that independent variable is often included as a\n[manipulation check]. This is done to confirm that the independent\nvariable was, in fact, successfully manipulated. For example, Schnall\nand her colleagues had their participants rate their level of disgust to\nbe sure that those in the messy room actually felt more disgusted than\nthose in the clean room. Manipulation checks are usually done at the end\nof the procedure to be sure that the effect of the manipulation lasted\nthroughout the entire procedure and to avoid calling unnecessary\nattention to the manipulation.\n\nManipulation checks become especially important when the manipulation of\nthe independent variable turns out to have no effect on the dependent\nvariable. Imagine, for example, that you exposed participants to happy\nor sad movie music---intending to put them in happy or sad moods---but\nyou found that this had no effect on the number of happy or sad\nchildhood events they recalled. This could be because being in a happy\nor sad mood has no effect on memories for childhood events. But it could\nalso be that the music was ineffective at putting participants in happy\nor sad moods. A manipulation check---in this case, a measure of\nparticipants' moods---would help resolve this uncertainty. If it showed\nthat you had successfully manipulated participants' moods, then it would\nappear that there is indeed no effect of mood on memory for childhood\nevents. But if it showed that you did not successfully manipulate\nparticipants' moods, then it would appear that you need a more effective\nmanipulation to answer your research question.\n\n### Measures of the Same Construct {.unnumbered}\n\nAnother common approach to including multiple dependent variables is to\noperationally define and measure the same construct, or closely related\nones, in different ways. Imagine, for example, that a researcher\nconducts an experiment on the effect of daily exercise on stress. The\ndependent variable, stress, is a construct that can be operationally\ndefined in different ways. For this reason, the researcher might have\nparticipants complete the paper-and-pencil Perceived Stress Scale *and*\nmeasure their levels of the stress hormone cortisol. This is an example\nof the use of converging operations. If the researcher finds that the\ndifferent measures are affected by exercise in the same way, then he or\nshe can be confident in the conclusion that exercise affects the more\ngeneral construct of stress.\n\nWhen multiple dependent variables are different measures of the same\nconstruct---especially if they are measured on the same\nscale---researchers have the option of combining them into a single\nmeasure of that construct. Recall that Schnall and her colleagues were\ninterested in the harshness of people's moral judgments. To measure this\nconstruct, they presented their participants with seven different\nscenarios describing morally questionable behaviors and asked them to\nrate the moral acceptability of each one. Although they could have\ntreated each of the seven ratings as a separate dependent variable,\nthese researchers combined them into a single dependent variable by\ncomputing their mean.\n\nWhen researchers combine dependent variables in this way, they are\ntreating them collectively as a multiple-response measure of a single\nconstruct. The advantage of this is that multiple-response measures are\ngenerally more reliable than single-response measures. However, it is\nimportant to make sure the individual dependent variables are correlated\nwith each other by computing an internal consistency measure such as\nCronbach's Î±. If they are not correlated with each other, then it does\nnot make sense to combine them into a measure of a single construct. If\nthey have poor internal consistency, then they should be treated as\nseparate dependent variables.\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   Researchers in psychology often include multiple dependent variables\n    in their studies. The primary reason is that this easily allows them\n    to answer more research questions with minimal additional effort.\n-   When an independent variable is a construct that is manipulated\n    indirectly, it is a good idea to include a manipulation check. This\n    is a measure of the independent variable typically given at the end\n    of the procedure to confirm that it was successfully manipulated.\n-   Multiple measures of the same construct can be analyzed separately\n    or combined to produce a single multiple-item measure of that\n    construct. The latter approach requires that the measures taken\n    together have good internal consistency.\n:::\n\n::: exercises\n##### EXERCISES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Practice: List three independent variables for which it would be\n    good to include a manipulation check. List three others for which a\n    manipulation check would be unnecessary.\n2.  Practice: Imagine a study in which the independent variable is\n    whether the room where participants are tested is warm (80Â°) or cool\n    (65Â°). List three dependent variables that you might treat as\n    measures of separate variables. List three more that you might\n    combine and treat as measures of the same underlying construct.\n:::\n\n## Multiple Independent Variables\n\n::: learningobjectives\n##### LEARNING OBJECTIVES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Explain why researchers often include multiple independent variables\n    in their studies.\n2.  Define factorial design, and use a factorial design table to\n    represent and interpret simple factorial designs.\n3.  Distinguish between main effects and interactions, and recognize and\n    give examples of each.\n4.  Sketch and interpret bar graphs and line graphs showing the results\n    of studies with simple factorial designs.\n:::\n\nJust as it is common for studies in psychology to include multiple\ndependent variables, it is also common for them to include multiple\nindependent variables. Schnall and her colleagues studied the effect of\nboth disgust and private body consciousness in the same study.\nResearchers' inclusion of multiple independent variables in one\nexperiment is further illustrated by the following actual titles from\nvarious professional journals:\n\n-   The Effects of Temporal Delay and Orientation on Haptic Object\n    Recognition\n-   Opening Closed Minds: The Combined Effects of Intergroup Contact and\n    Need for Closure on Prejudice\n-   Effects of Expectancies and Coping on Pain-Induced Intentions to\n    Smoke\n-   The Effect of Age and Divided Attention on Spontaneous Recognition\n-   The Effects of Reduced Food Size and Package Size on the Consumption\n    Behavior of Restrained and Unrestrained Eaters\n\nJust as including multiple dependent variables in the same experiment\nallows one to answer more research questions, so too does including\nmultiple independent variables in the same experiment. For example,\ninstead of conducting one study on the effect of disgust on moral\njudgment and another on the effect of private body consciousness on\nmoral judgment, Schnall and colleagues were able to conduct one study\nthat addressed both questions. But including multiple independent\nvariables also allows the researcher to answer questions about whether\nthe effect of one independent variable depends on the level of another.\nThis is referred to as an interaction between the independent variables.\nSchnall and her colleagues, for example, observed an interaction between\ndisgust and private body consciousness because the effect of disgust\ndepended on whether participants were high or low in private body\nconsciousness. As we will see, interactions are often among the most\ninteresting results in psychological research.\n\n### Factorial Designs {.unnumbered}\n\n#### Overview {.unnumbered}\n\nBy far the most common approach to including multiple independent\nvariables in an experiment is the [factorial design]. In a factorial\ndesign, each level of one independent variable (which can also be called\na [factor]) is combined with each level of the others to produce all\npossible combinations. Each combination, then, becomes a condition in\nthe experiment. Imagine, for example, an experiment on the effect of\ncell phone use (yes vs. no) and time of day (day vs. night) on driving\nability. This is shown in the [factorial design table] in Figure\n\\@ref(fig:designtable). The columns of the table represent cell phone\nuse, and the rows represent time of day. The four cells of the table\nrepresent the four possible combinations or conditions: using a cell\nphone during the day, not using a cell phone during the day, using a\ncell phone at night, and not using a cell phone at night. This\nparticular design is a 2 Ã 2 (read \"two-by-two\") factorial design\nbecause it combines two variables, each of which has two levels. If one\nof the independent variables had a third level (e.g., using a handheld\ncell phone, using a hands-free cell phone, and not using a cell phone),\nthen it would be a 3 Ã 2 factorial design, and there would be six\ndistinct conditions. Notice that the number of possible conditions is\nthe product of the numbers of levels. A 2 Ã 2 factorial design has four\nconditions, a 3 Ã 2 factorial design has six conditions, a 4 Ã 5\nfactorial design would have 20 conditions, and so on.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Factorial design table representing a 2 x 2 factorial design.](images/complex-designs/designtable.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIn principle, factorial designs can include any number of independent\nvariables with any number of levels. For example, an experiment could\ninclude the type of psychotherapy (cognitive vs. behavioral), the length\nof the psychotherapy (2 weeks vs. 2 months), and the sex of the\npsychotherapist (female vs. male). This would be a 2 Ã 2 Ã 2 factorial\ndesign and would have eight conditions. Figure \\@ref(fig:designtable2)\nshows one way to represent this design. In practice, it is unusual for\nthere to be more than three independent variables with more than two or\nthree levels each because the number of conditions can quickly become\nunmanageable. For example, adding a fourth independent variable with\nthree levels (e.g., therapist experience: low vs. medium vs. high) to\nthe current example would make it a 2 Ã 2 Ã 2 Ã 3 factorial design with\n24 distinct conditions. In the rest of this section, we will focus on\ndesigns with two independent variables. The general principles discussed\nhere extend in a straightforward way to more complex factorial designs.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Factorial design table representing a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design.](images/complex-designs/designtable2.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Assigning Participants to Conditions {.unnumbered}\n\nRecall that in a simple between-subjects design, each participant is\ntested in only one condition. In a simple within-subjects design, each\nparticipant is tested in all conditions. In a factorial experiment, the\ndecision to take the between-subjects or within-subjects approach must\nbe made separately for each independent variable. In a [between-subjects\nfactorial design], all of the independent variables are manipulated\nbetween subjects. For example, all participants could be tested either\nwhile using a cell phone or while not using a cell phone and either\nduring the day or during the night. This would mean that each\nparticipant was tested in one and only one condition. In a\n[within-subjects factorial design], all of the independent variables are\nmanipulated within subjects. All participants could be tested both while\nusing a cell phone and while not using a cell phone and both during the\nday and during the night. This would mean that each participant was\ntested in all conditions. The advantages and disadvantages of these two\napproaches are the same as those discussed in the chapter on\nexperimental research. The between-subjects design is conceptually\nsimpler, avoids carryover effects, and minimizes the time and effort of\neach participant. The within-subjects design is more efficient for the\nresearcher and controls extraneous participant variables.\n\nIt is also possible to manipulate one independent variable between\nsubjects and another within subjects. This is called a [mixed factorial\ndesign]. For example, a researcher might choose to treat cell phone use\nas a within-subjects factor by testing the same participants both while\nusing a cell phone and while not using a cell phone (while\ncounterbalancing the order of these two conditions). But he or she might\nchoose to treat time of day as a between-subjects factor by testing each\nparticipant either during the day or during the night (perhaps because\nthis only requires them to come in for testing once). Thus each\nparticipant in this mixed design would be tested in two of the four\nconditions.\n\nRegardless of whether the design is between subjects, within subjects,\nor mixed, the actual assignment of participants to conditions or orders\nof conditions is typically done randomly.\n\n#### Nonmanipulated Independent Variables {.unnumbered}\n\nIn many factorial designs, one of the independent variables is a\n[nonmanipulated independent variable]. The researcher measures it but\ndoes not manipulate it. The study by Schnall and colleagues is a good\nexample. One independent variable was disgust, which the researchers\nmanipulated by testing participants in a clean room or a messy room. The\nother was private body consciousness, which the researchers simply\nmeasured. Another example is a study by Halle Brown and colleagues in\nwhich participants were exposed to several words that they were later\nasked to recall [@brown1999perceptual]. The manipulated independent\nvariable was the type of word. Some were negative health-related words\n(e.g., *tumor*, *coronary*), and others were not health related (e.g.,\n*election*, *geometry*). The nonmanipulated independent variable was\nwhether participants were high or low in hypochondriasis (excessive\nconcern with ordinary bodily symptoms). The result of this study was\nthat the participants high in hypochondriasis were better than those low\nin hypochondriasis at recalling the health-related words, but they were\nno better at recalling the non-health-related words.\n\nSuch studies are extremely common, and there are several points worth\nmaking about them. First, nonmanipulated independent variables are\nusually participant variables (private body consciousness,\nhypochondriasis, self-esteem, and so on), and as such they are by\ndefinition between-subjects factors. For example, people are either low\nin hypochondriasis or high in hypochondriasis; they cannot be tested in\nboth of these conditions. Second, such studies are generally considered\nto be experiments as long as at least one independent variable is\nmanipulated, regardless of how many nonmanipulated independent variables\nare included. Third, it is important to remember that causal conclusions\ncan only be drawn about the manipulated independent variable. For\nexample, Schnall and her colleagues were justified in concluding that\ndisgust affected the harshness of their participants' moral judgments\nbecause they manipulated that variable and randomly assigned\nparticipants to the clean or messy room. But they would not have been\njustified in concluding that participants' private body consciousness\naffected the harshness of their participants' moral judgments because\nthey did not manipulate that variable. It could be, for example, that\nhaving a strict moral code and a heightened awareness of one's body are\nboth caused by some third variable (e.g., neuroticism). Thus it is\nimportant to be aware of which variables in a study are manipulated and\nwhich are not.\n\n#### Graphing the Results of Factorial Experiments {.unnumbered}\n\nThe results of factorial experiments with two independent variables can\nbe graphed by representing one independent variable on the x-axis and\nrepresenting the other by using different kinds of bars or lines. (The\ny-axis is always reserved for the dependent variable.) Figure\n\\@ref(fig:plots) shows results for two hypothetical factorial\nexperiments. The top panel shows the results of a 2 Ã 2 design. Time of\nday (day vs. night) is represented by different locations on the x-axis,\nand cell phone use (no vs. yes) is represented by different-colored\nbars. (It would also be possible to represent cell phone use on the\nx-axis and time of day as different-colored bars. The choice comes down\nto which way seems to communicate the results most clearly.) The bottom\npanel of Figure \\@ref(fig:plots) shows the results of a 4 Ã 2 design in\nwhich one of the variables is quantitative. This variable, psychotherapy\nlength, is represented along the x-axis, and the other variable\n(psychotherapy type) is represented by differently formatted lines. This\nis a line graph rather than a bar graph because the variable on the\nx-axis is quantitative with a small number of distinct levels.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Two ways to plot the results of a factorial experiment with two independent variables.](08-complex-designs_files/figure-pdf/plots-1.pdf){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Two ways to plot the results of a factorial experiment with two independent variables.](08-complex-designs_files/figure-pdf/plots-2.pdf){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Main Effects and Interactions {.unnumbered}\n\nIn factorial designs, there are two kinds of results that are of\ninterest: main effects and interaction effects (which are also called\njust \"interactions\"). A main effect is the statistical relationship\nbetween one independent variable and a dependent variable---averaging\nacross the levels of the other independent variable. Thus there is one\nmain effect to consider for each independent variable in the study. The\ntop panel of Figure \\@ref(fig:plots) shows a main effect of cell phone\nuse because driving performance was better, on average, when\nparticipants were not using cell phones than when they were. The blue\nbars are, on average, higher than the red bars. It also shows a main\neffect of time of day because driving performance was better during the\nday than during the night---both when participants were using cell\nphones and when they were not. Main effects are independent of each\nother in the sense that whether or not there is a main effect of one\nindependent variable says nothing about whether or not there is a main\neffect of the other. The bottom panel of Figure \\@ref(fig:plots), for\nexample, shows a clear main effect of psychotherapy length. The longer\nthe psychotherapy, the better it worked. But it also shows no overall\nadvantage of one type of psychotherapy over the other.\n\nThere is an interaction effect (or just \"interaction\") when the effect\nof one independent variable depends on the level of another. Although\nthis might seem complicated, you have an intuitive understanding of\ninteractions already. It probably would not surprise you, for example,\nto hear that the effect of receiving psychotherapy is stronger among\npeople who are highly motivated to change than among people who are not\nmotivated to change. This is an interaction because the effect of one\nindependent variable (whether or not one receives psychotherapy) depends\non the level of another (motivation to change). Schnall and her\ncolleagues also demonstrated an interaction because the effect of\nwhether the room was clean or messy on participants' moral judgments\ndepended on whether the participants were low or high in private body\nconsciousness. If they were high in private body consciousness, then\nthose in the messy room made harsher judgments. If they were low in\nprivate body consciousness, then whether the room was clean or messy did\nnot matter.\n\nThe effect of one independent variable can depend on the level of the\nother in different ways. This is shown in Figure\n\\@ref(fig:barinteractions). In the top panel, one independent variable\nhas an effect at one level of the second independent variable but no\neffect at the others. (This is much like the study of Schnall and her\ncolleagues where there was an effect of disgust for those high in\nprivate body consciousness but not for those low in private body\nconsciousness.) In the middle panel, one independent variable has a\nstronger effect at one level of the second independent variable than at\nthe other level. This is like the hypothetical driving example where\nthere was a stronger effect of using a cell phone at night than during\nthe day. In the bottom panel, one independent variable again has an\neffect at both levels of the second independent variable, but the\neffects are in opposite directions. Figure \\@ref(fig:barinteractions)\nshows the strongest form of this kind of interaction, called a crossover\ninteraction. One example of a crossover interaction comes from a study\nby Kathy Gilliland on the effect of caffeine on the verbal test scores\nof introverts and extroverts [@gilliland1980interactive]. Introverts\nperform better than extroverts when they have not ingested any caffeine.\nBut extroverts perform better than introverts when they have ingested 4\nmg of caffeine per kilogram of body weight. Figure\n\\@ref(fig:lineinteractions) shows examples of these same kinds of\ninteractions when one of the independent variables is quantitative and\nthe results are plotted in a line graph. Note that in a crossover\ninteraction, the two lines literally \"cross over\" each other.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bar graphs showing three types of interactions.

In this section, we look at some approaches to complex\ncorrelational research that involve measuring several variables and\nassessing the relationships among them.\n\n### Correlational Studies With Factorial Designs {.unnumbered}\n\nWe have already seen that factorial experiments can include manipulated\nindependent variables or a combination of manipulated and nonmanipulated\nindependent variables. But factorial designs can also include *only*\nnonmanipulated independent variables, in which case they are no longer\nexperiments but correlational studies. Consider a hypothetical study in\nwhich a researcher measures both the moods and the self-esteem of\nseveral participants---categorizing them as having either a positive or\nnegative mood and as being either high or low in self-esteem---along\nwith their willingness to have unprotected sexual intercourse. This can\nbe conceptualized as a 2 Ã 2 factorial design with mood (positive vs.\nnegative) and self-esteem (high vs. low) as between-subjects factors.\n(Willingness to have unprotected sex is the dependent variable.) This\ndesign can be represented in a factorial design table and the results in\na bar graph of the sort we have already seen. The researcher would\nconsider the main effect of sex, the main effect of self-esteem, and the\ninteraction between these two independent variables.\n\nAgain, because neither independent variable in this example was\nmanipulated, it is a correlational study rather than an experiment. (The\nsimilar study by MacDonald and Martineau was an experiment because they\nmanipulated their participants' moods; @macdonald2002self.) This is\nimportant because, as always, one must be cautious about inferring\ncausality from correlational studies because of the directionality and\nthird-variable problems. For example, a main effect of participants'\nmoods on their willingness to have unprotected sex might be caused by\nany other variable that happens to be correlated with their moods.\n\n### Assessing Relationships Among Multiple Variables {.unnumbered}\n\nMost complex correlational research, however, does not fit neatly into a\nfactorial design. Instead, it involves measuring several\nvariables---often both categorical and quantitative---and then assessing\nthe statistical relationships among them. For example, researchers\nNathan Radcliffe and William Klein studied a sample of middle-aged\nadults to see how their level of optimism (measured by using a short\nquestionnaire called the Life Orientation Test) relates to several other\nvariables related to having a heart attack\n[@radcliffe2002dispositional]. These included their health, their\nknowledge of heart attack risk factors, and their beliefs about their\nown risk of having a heart attack. They found that more optimistic\nparticipants were healthier (e.g., they exercised more and had lower\nblood pressure), knew about heart attack risk factors, and correctly\nbelieved their own risk to be lower than that of their peers.\n\nThis approach is often used to assess the validity of new psychological\nmeasures. For example, when John Cacioppo and Richard Petty created\ntheir Need for Cognition Scale---a measure of the extent to which people\nlike to think and value thinking---they used it to measure the need for\ncognition for a large sample of college students, along with three other\nvariables: intelligence, socially desirable responding (the tendency to\ngive what one thinks is the \"appropriate\" response), and dogmatism\n[@cacioppo1982need]. The results of this study are summarized in Table\n\\@ref(tab:nfc), which is a correlation matrix showing the correlation\n(Pearson's r) between every possible pair of variables in the study. For\nexample, the correlation between the need for cognition and intelligence\nwas +.39, the correlation between intelligence and socially desirable\nresponding was â.02, and so on. (Only half the matrix is filled in\nbecause the other half would contain exactly the same information. Also,\nbecause the correlation between a variable and itself is always +1.00,\nthese values are replaced with dashes throughout the matrix.) In this\ncase, the overall pattern of correlations was consistent with the\nresearchers' ideas about how scores on the need for cognition should be\nrelated to these other constructs.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nTable: Correlation matrix showing correlations among the need for cognition and three other variables based on research by Cacioppo and Petty.\n\n|                    |Need for cognition |Intelligence |Social desirability |Dogmatism |\n|:-------------------|:------------------|:------------|:-------------------|:---------|\n|Need for cognition  |â                  |             |                    |          |\n|Intelligence        |+.39               |â            |                    |          |\n|Social desirability |+.08               |+.02         |â                   |          |\n|Dogmatism           |-.27               |-.23         |+.03                |â         |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWhen researchers study relationships among a large number of\nconceptually similar variables, they often use a complex statistical\ntechnique called [factor analysis]. In essence, factor analysis\norganizes the variables into a smaller number of clusters, such that\nthey are strongly correlated within each cluster but weakly correlated\nbetween clusters. Each cluster is then interpreted as multiple measures\nof the same underlying construct. These underlying constructs are also\ncalled \"factors.\" For example, when people perform a wide variety of\nmental tasks, factor analysis typically organizes them into two main\nfactors---one that researchers interpret as mathematical intelligence\n(arithmetic, quantitative estimation, spatial reasoning, and so on) and\nanother that they interpret as verbal intelligence (grammar, reading\ncomprehension, vocabulary, and so on). The Big Five personality factors\nhave been identified through factor analyses of people's scores on a\nlarge number of more specific traits. For example, measures of warmth,\ngregariousness, activity level, and positive emotions tend to be highly\ncorrelated with each other and are interpreted as representing the\nconstruct of extroversion. As a final example, researchers Peter\nRentfrow and Samuel Gosling asked more than 1,700 college students to\nrate how much they liked 14 different popular genres of music\n[@rentfrow2003re]. They then submitted these 14 variables to a factor\nanalysis, which identified four distinct factors. The researchers called\nthem *Reflective and Complex* (blues, jazz, classical, and folk),\n*Intense and Rebellious* (rock, alternative, and heavy metal), *Upbeat\nand Conventional* (country, soundtrack, religious, pop), and *Energetic\nand Rhythmic* (rap/hip-hop, soul/funk, and electronica).\n\nTwo additional points about factor analysis are worth making here. One\nis that factors are not categories. Factor analysis does not tell us\nthat people are *either* extroverted *or* conscientious or that they\nlike *either* \"reflective and complex\" music *or* \"intense and\nrebellious\" music. Instead, factors are constructs that operate\nindependently of each other. So people who are high in extroversion\nmight be high or low in conscientiousness, and people who like\nreflective and complex music might or might not also like intense and\nrebellious music. The second point is that factor analysis reveals only\nthe underlying structure of the variables. It is up to researchers to\ninterpret and label the factors and to explain the origin of that\nparticular factor structure. For example, one reason that extroversion\nand the other Big Five operate as separate factors is that they appear\nto be controlled by different genes [@plomin2008behavioral].\n\n### Exploring Causal Relationships {.unnumbered}\n\nAnother important use of complex correlational research is to explore\npossible causal relationships among variables. This might seem\nsurprising given that \"correlation does not imply causation.\" It is true\nthat correlational research cannot unambiguously establish that one\nvariable causes another. Complex correlational research, however, can\noften be used to rule out other plausible interpretations.\n\nThe primary way of doing this is through the [statistical control] of\npotential third variables. Instead of controlling these variables by\nrandom assignment or by holding them constant as in an experiment, the\nresearcher measures them and includes them in the statistical analysis.\nConsider some research by Paul Piff and his colleagues, who hypothesized\nthat being lower in socioeconomic status (SES) causes people to be more\ngenerous [@piff2010having]. They measured their participants' SES and\nhad them play the \"dictator game.\" They told participants that each\nwould be paired with another participant in a different room. (In\nreality, there was no other participant.) Then they gave each\nparticipant 10 points (which could later be converted to money) to split\nwith the \"partner\" in whatever way he or she decided. Because the\nparticipants were the \"dictators,\" they could even keep all 10 points\nfor themselves if they wanted to.\n\nAs these researchers expected, participants who were lower in SES tended\nto give away more of their points than participants who were higher in\nSES. This is consistent with the idea that being lower in SES causes\npeople to be more generous. But there are also plausible third variables\nthat could explain this relationship. It could be, for example, that\npeople who are lower in SES tend to be more religious and that it is\ntheir greater religiosity that causes them to be more generous. Or it\ncould be that people who are lower in SES tend to come from ethnic\ngroups that emphasize generosity more than other ethnic groups. The\nresearchers dealt with these potential third variables, however, by\nmeasuring them and including them in their statistical analyses. They\nfound that neither religiosity nor ethnicity was correlated with\ngenerosity and were therefore able to rule them out as third variables.\nThis does not prove that SES causes greater generosity because there\ncould still be other third variables that the researchers did not\nmeasure. But by ruling out some of the most plausible third variables,\nthe researchers made a stronger case for SES as the cause of the greater\ngenerosity.\n\nMany studies of this type use a statistical technique called [multiple\nregression]. This involves measuring several independent variables\n($X_1, X_2, X_3,â¦, X_i$), all of which are possible causes of a single\ndependent variable ($Y$). The result of a multiple regression analysis\nis an equation that expresses the dependent variable as an additive\ncombination of the independent variables. This regression equation has\nthe following general form:\n\n$b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + b_3X_3+ â¦ + b_iX_i= Y$\n\nThe quantities $b_1$, $b_2$, and so on are regression weights that\nindicate how large a contribution an independent variable makes, on\naverage, to the dependent variable. Specifically, they indicate how much\nthe dependent variable changes for each one-unit change in the\nindependent variable.\n\nThe advantage of multiple regression is that it can show whether an\nindependent variable makes a contribution to a dependent variable *over\nand above* the contributions made by other independent variables. As a\nhypothetical example, imagine that a researcher wants to know how the\nindependent variables of income and health relate to the dependent\nvariable of happiness. This is tricky because income and health are\nthemselves related to each other. Thus if people with greater incomes\ntend to be happier, then perhaps this is only because they tend to be\nhealthier. Likewise, if people who are healthier tend to be happier,\nperhaps this is only because they tend to make more money. But a\nmultiple regression analysis including both income and happiness as\nindependent variables would show whether each one makes a contribution\nto happiness when the other is taken into account. (Research like this,\nby the way, has shown both income and health make extremely small\ncontributions to happiness except in the case of severe poverty or\nillness; @diener2000subjective)\n\nThe examples discussed in this section only scratch the surface of how\nresearchers use complex correlational research to explore possible\ncausal relationships among variables. It is important to keep in mind,\nhowever, that purely correlational approaches cannot unambiguously\nestablish that one variable causes another. The best they can do is show\npatterns of relationships that are consistent with some causal\ninterpretations and inconsistent with others.\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   Researchers often use complex correlational research to explore\n    relationships among several variables in the same study.\n-   Complex correlational research can be used to explore possible\n    causal relationships among variables using techniques such as\n    multiple regression.
