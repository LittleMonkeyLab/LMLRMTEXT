In\n> these studies, individuals are randomly assigned to write about either\n> emotional or nonemotional topics for 15 to 20 min per day for 3 to 5\n> consecutive days.

It does. But there is a second\nquestion that is equally interesting and important: Why? What\npsychological and biological variables, structures, and processes are\ninvolved, and how do they connect the act of expressive writing to\nimproved health? Several ideas have been proposed. For example, people\nwho write about traumatic experiences might habituate to them. That is,\nthe more they think about them, the less negatively they react both\npsychologically and physiologically---leading to improvements in mental\nand physical health [@lepore2002expressive].\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scientific research has shown that engaging in expressive writing causes improvements in health. Several theories have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. *Photo by lilartsy on Unsplash.*](images/theory/writing.jpeg){fig-align='center' width=40%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis example illustrates that, like all scientists, researchers in\npsychology distinguish between two sorts of knowledge: their systematic\nobservations and their explanations or interpretations of those\nobservations. Typically, the former are called phenomena and the latter\nare called theories. Up to this point in the book, we have focused on\nphenomena. In this chapter, however, we focus on the equally important\nrole of theories. We begin by exploring the distinction between\nphenomena and theories in more detail. We then look at the wide variety\nof theories that researchers in psychology construct. Finally, we\nconsider how researchers use theories, and we present some strategies\nfor incorporating theory into your own research.\n\n## Phenomena and Theories\n\n::: learningobjectives\n##### LEARNING OBJECTIVES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Define the terms phenomenon and theory and distinguish clearly\n    between them.\n2.  Explain the purposes of scientific theories.\n3.  Explain why there are usually many plausible theories for any set of\n    phenomena.\n:::\n\n### Phenomena {.unnumbered}\n\nA [phenomenon] (plural, phenomena) is a general result that has been\nobserved reliably in systematic empirical research. In essence, it is an\nestablished answer to a research question. Some phenomena we have\nencountered in this book are that expressive writing improves health,\nwomen do not talk more than men, and cell phone usage impairs driving\nability. Some others are that dissociative identity disorder (formerly\ncalled multiple personality disorder) increased greatly in prevalence\nduring the late 20th century, people perform better on easy tasks when\nthey are being watched by others (and worse on difficult tasks), and\npeople recall items presented at the beginning and end of a list better\nthan items presented in the middle.\n\n::: fyi\n##### Some Famous Psychological Phenomena {.unnumbered}\n\nPhenomena are often given names by their discoverers or other\nresearchers, and these names can catch on and become widely known. The\nfollowing list is a small sample of famous phenomena in psychology.\n\n-   **Blindsight.** People with damage to their visual cortex are often\n    able to respond to visual stimuli that they do not consciously see.\n-   **Bystander effect.** The more people who are present at an\n    emergency situation, the less likely it is that any one of them will\n    help.\n-   **Fundamental attribution error.** People tend to explain others'\n    behavior in terms of their personal characteristics as opposed to\n    the situation they are in.\n-   **McGurk effect.** When audio of a basic speech sound is combined\n    with video of a person making mouth movements for a different speech\n    sound, people often perceive a sound that is intermediate between\n    the two.\n-   **Own-race effect.** People recognize faces of people of their own\n    race more accurately than faces of people of other races.\n-   **Placebo effect.** Placebos (fake psychological or medical\n    treatments) often lead to improvements in people's symptoms and\n    functioning.\n-   **Mere exposure effect.** The more often people have been exposed to\n    a stimulus, the more they like it---even when the stimulus is\n    presented subliminally.\n-   **Serial position effect.** Stimuli presented near the beginning and\n    end of a list are remembered better than stimuli presented in the\n    middle.\n-   **Spontaneous recovery.** A conditioned response that has been\n    extinguished often returns with no further training after the\n    passage of time.\n:::\n\nAlthough an empirical result might be referred to as a phenomenon after\nbeing observed only once, this term is more likely to be used for\nresults that have been replicated. [Replication] means conducting a\nstudy again---either exactly as it was originally conducted or with\nmodifications---to be sure that it produces the same results. Individual\nresearchers usually replicate their own studies before publishing them.\nMany empirical research reports include an initial study and then one or\nmore follow-up studies that replicate the initial study with minor\nmodifications. Particularly interesting results come to the attention of\nother researchers who conduct their own replications. The positive\neffect of expressive writing on health and the negative effect of cell\nphone usage on driving ability are examples of phenomena that have been\nreplicated many times by many different researchers.\n\nSometimes a replication of a study produces results that differ from the\nresults of the initial study. This could mean that the results of the\ninitial study or the results of the replication were a fluke---they\noccurred by chance and do not reflect something that is generally true.\nIn either case, additional replications would be likely to resolve this.\nA failure to produce the same results could also mean that the\nreplication differed in some important way from the initial study. For\nexample, early studies showed that people performed a variety of tasks\nbetter and faster when they were watched by others than when they were\nalone. Some later replications, however, showed that people performed\nworse when they were watched by others. Eventually researcher Robert\nZajonc identified a key difference between the two types of studies.\nPeople seemed to perform better when being watched on highly practiced\ntasks but worse when being watched on relatively unpracticed tasks\n[@zajonc1965social]. These two phenomena have now come to be called\nsocial facilitation and social inhibition.\n\n### Theories {.unnumbered}\n\n#### What Is a Theory? {.unnumbered}\n\nA [theory] is a coherent explanation or interpretation of one or more\nphenomena. Although theories can take a variety of forms, one thing they\nhave in common is that they go beyond the phenomena they explain by\nincluding variables, structures, processes, functions, or organizing\nprinciples that have not been observed directly. Consider, for example,\nZajonc's theory of social facilitation and social inhibition. He\nproposed that being watched by others while performing a task creates a\ngeneral state of physiological arousal, which increases the likelihood\nof the dominant (most likely) response. So for highly practiced tasks,\nbeing watched increases the tendency to make correct responses, but for\nrelatively unpracticed tasks, being watched increases the tendency to\nmake incorrect responses. Notice that this theory---which has come to be\ncalled drive theory---provides an explanation of both social\nfacilitation and social inhibition that goes beyond the phenomena\nthemselves by including concepts such as \"arousal\" and \"dominant\nresponse,\" along with processes such as the effect of arousal on the\ndominant response.\n\nOutside of science, referring to an idea as a *theory* often implies\nthat it is untested---perhaps no more than a wild guess. In science,\nhowever, the term theory has no such implication. A theory is simply an\nexplanation or interpretation of a set of phenomena. It *can* be\nuntested, but it can also be extensively tested, well supported, and\naccepted as an accurate description of the world by the scientific\ncommunity. The theory of evolution by natural selection, for example, is\na theory because it is an explanation of the diversity of life on\nearth---not because it is untested or unsupported by scientific\nresearch. On the contrary, the evidence for this theory is\noverwhelmingly positive and nearly all scientists accept its basic\nassumptions as accurate. Similarly, the \"germ theory\" of disease is a\ntheory because it is an explanation of the origin of various diseases,\nnot because there is any doubt that many diseases are caused by\nmicroorganisms that infect the body.\n\nIn addition to *theory*, researchers in psychology use several related\nterms to refer to their explanations and interpretations of phenomena. A\n[perspective] is a broad approach---more general than a theory---to\nexplaining and interpreting phenomena. For example, researchers who take\na biological perspective tend to explain phenomena in terms of genetics\nor nervous and endocrine system structures and processes, while\nresearchers who take a behavioral perspective tend to explain phenomena\nin terms of reinforcement, punishment, and other external events. A\n[model] is a precise explanation or interpretation of a specific\nphenomenon---often expressed in terms of equations, computer programs,\nor biological structures and processes. A [hypothesis] can be an\nexplanation that relies on just a few key concepts---although this term\nmore commonly refers to a prediction about a new phenomenon based on a\ntheory (see Section \\@ref(using-theories-in-psychological-research)).\nAdding to the confusion is the fact that researchers often use these\nterms interchangeably. It would not be considered wrong to refer to the\ndrive theory as the drive model or even the drive hypothesis. And the\nbiopsychosocial model of health psychology---the general idea that\nhealth is determined by an interaction of biological, psychological, and\nsocial factors---is really more like a perspective as defined here. Keep\nin mind, however, that the most important distinction remains that\nbetween observations and interpretations.\n\n#### What Are Theories For? {.unnumbered}\n\nOf course, scientific theories are meant to provide accurate\nexplanations or interpretations of phenomena. But there must be more to\nit than this. Consider that a theory can be accurate without being very\nuseful. To say that expressive writing helps people \"deal with their\nemotions\" might be accurate as far as it goes, but it seems too vague to\nbe of much use. Consider also that a theory can be useful without being\nentirely accurate. Figure \\@ref(fig:memory) is a representation of the\nclassic multistore model of human memory, which is still cited by\nresearchers and discussed in textbooks despite the fact that it is now\nknown to be inaccurate in a number of ways [@izawa1999human]. These two\nexamples suggest that theories have purposes other than simply providing\naccurate explanations or interpretations. Here we look at three\nadditional purposes of theories: the organization of known phenomena,\nthe prediction of outcomes in new situations, and the generation of new\nresearch.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Representation of the multistore model of human memory. In the multistore model of human memory, information from the environment passes through a sensory store on its way to a short-term store, where it can be rehearsed, and then to a long-term store, where it can be stored and retrieved much later. This theory has been extremely successful at organizing old phenomena and predicting new ones.](images/theory/memory.png){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n##### Organization {.unnumbered}\n\nOne important purpose of scientific theories is to organize phenomena in\nways that help people think about them clearly and efficiently. The\ndrive theory of social facilitation and social inhibition, for example,\nhelps to organize and make sense of a large number of seemingly\ncontradictory results. The multistore model of human memory efficiently\nsummarizes many important phenomena: the limited capacity and short\nretention time of information that is attended to but not rehearsed, the\nimportance of rehearsing information for long-term retention, the\nserial-position effect, and so on. Or consider a classic theory of\nintelligence represented by Figure \\@ref(fig:g). According to this\ntheory, intelligence consists of a general mental ability, *g*, plus a\nsmall number of more specific abilities that are influenced by *g*\n[@neisser1996intelligence]. Although there are other theories of\nintelligence, this one does a good job of summarizing a large number of\nstatistical relationships between tests of various mental abilities.\nThis includes the fact that tests of all basic mental abilities tend to\nbe somewhat positively correlated and the fact that certain subsets of\nmental abilities (e.g., reading comprehension and analogy completion)\nare more positively correlated than others (e.g., reading comprehension\nand arithmetic).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Representation of one theory of intelligence. In this theory of intelligence, a general mental ability (*g*) influences each of three more specific mental abilities. Theories of this type help to organize a large number of statistical relationships among tests of various mental abilities.](images/theory/g.png){fig-align='center' width=45%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThus theories are good or useful to the extent that they organize more\nphenomena with greater clarity and efficiency. Scientists generally\nfollow the principle of [parsimony], which holds that a theory should\ninclude only as many concepts as are necessary to explain or interpret\nthe phenomena of interest. Simpler, more parsimonious theories organize\nphenomena more efficiently than more complex, less parsimonious\ntheories.\n\n##### Prediction {.unnumbered}\n\nA second purpose of theories is to allow researchers and others to make\npredictions about what will happen in new situations. For example, a\ngymnastics coach might wonder whether a student's performance is likely\nto be better or worse during a competition than when practicing alone.\nEven if this particular question has never been studied empirically,\nZajonc's drive theory suggests an answer. If the student generally\nperforms with no mistakes, she is likely to perform better during\ncompetition. If she generally performs with many mistakes, she is likely\nto perform worse.\n\nIn clinical psychology, treatment decisions are often guided by\ntheories. Consider, for example, dissociative identity disorder\n(formerly called multiple personality disorder). The prevailing\nscientific theory of dissociative identity disorder is that people\ndevelop multiple personalities (also called alters) because they are\nfamiliar with this idea from popular portrayals (e.g., the movie\n*Sybil*) and because they are unintentionally encouraged to do so by\ntheir clinicians (e.g., by asking to \"meet\" an alter). This theory\nimplies that rather than encouraging patients to act out multiple\npersonalities, treatment should involve discouraging them from doing\nthis [@lilienfeld2003dissociative].\n\n##### Generation of New Research {.unnumbered}\n\nA third purpose of theories is to generate new research by raising new\nquestions. Consider, for example, the theory that people engage in\nself-injurious behavior such as cutting because it reduces negative\nemotions such as sadness, anxiety, and anger. This theory immediately\nsuggests several new and interesting questions. Is there, in fact, a\nstatistical relationship between cutting and the amount of negative\nemotions experienced? Is it causal? If so, what is it about cutting that\nhas this effect? Is it the pain, the sight of the injury, or something\nelse? Does cutting affect all negative emotions equally?\n\nNotice that a theory does not have to be accurate to serve this purpose.\nEven an inaccurate theory can generate new and interesting research\nquestions. Of course, if the theory is inaccurate, the answers to the\nnew questions will tend to be inconsistent with the theory. This will\nlead researchers to reevaluate the theory and either revise it or\nabandon it for a new one. And this is how scientific theories become\nmore detailed and accurate over time.\n\n#### Multiple Theories {.unnumbered}\n\nAt any point in time, researchers are usually considering multiple\ntheories for any set of phenomena. One reason is that because human\nbehavior is extremely complex, it is always possible to look at it from\ndifferent perspectives. For example, a biological theory of sexual\norientation might focus on the role of sex hormones during critical\nperiods of brain development, while a sociocultural theory might focus\non cultural factors that influence how underlying biological tendencies\nare expressed. A second reason is that---even from the same\nperspective---there are usually different ways to \"go beyond\" the\nphenomena of interest. For example, in addition to the drive theory of\nsocial facilitation and social inhibition, there is another theory that\nexplains them in terms of a construct called \"evaluation\napprehension\"---anxiety about being evaluated by the audience. Both\ntheories go beyond the phenomena to be interpreted, but they do so by\nproposing somewhat different underlying processes.\n\nDifferent theories of the same set of phenomena can be\ncomplementary---with each one supplying one piece of a larger puzzle. A\nbiological theory of sexual orientation and a sociocultural theory of\nsexual orientation might accurately describe different aspects of the\nsame complex phenomenon. Similarly, social facilitation could be the\nresult of both general physiological arousal and evaluation\napprehension. But different theories of the same phenomena can also be\ncompeting in the sense that if one is accurate, the other is probably\nnot. For example, an alternative theory of dissociative identity\ndisorder---the posttraumatic theory---holds that alters are created\nunconsciously by the patient as a means of coping with sexual abuse or\nsome other traumatic experience. Because the sociocognitive theory and\nthe posttraumatic theories attribute dissociative identity disorder to\nfundamentally different processes, it seems unlikely that both can be\naccurate. See the FYI box below, \"Where Do Multiple Personalities Come\nFrom?,\" for more on these competing theories.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple theories for any set of phenomena does\nnot mean that any theory is as good as any other or that it is\nimpossible to know whether a theory provides an accurate explanation or\ninterpretation. On the contrary, scientists are continually comparing\ntheories in terms of their ability to organize phenomena, predict\noutcomes in new situations, and generate research. Those that fare\npoorly are assumed to be less accurate and are abandoned, while those\nthat fare well are assumed to be more accurate and are retained and\ncompared with newer---and hopefully better---theories. Although\nscientists generally do not believe that their theories ever provide\nperfectly accurate descriptions of the world, they do assume that this\nprocess produces theories that come closer and closer to that ideal.\n\n::: fyi\n##### Where Do Multiple Personalities Come From? {.unnumbered}\n\nThe literature on dissociative identity disorder (DID) features two\ncompeting theories. The sociocognitive theory is that DID comes about\nbecause patients are aware of the disorder, know its characteristic\nfeatures, and are encouraged to take on multiple personalities by their\ntherapists. The posttraumatic theory is that multiple personalities\ndevelop as a way of coping with sexual abuse or some other trauma. There\nare now several lines of evidence that support the sociocognitive model\nover the posttraumatic model [@lilienfeld2003dissociative].\n\n-   Diagnosis of DID greatly increased after the release of the book and\n    film Sybil---about a woman with DID---in the 1970s.\n-   DID is extremely rare outside of North America.\n-   A very small percentage of therapists are responsible for diagnosing\n    the vast majority of cases of DID.\n-   The literature on treating DID includes many practices that\n    encourage patients to act out multiple personalities (e.g., having a\n    bulletin board on which personalities can leave messages for each\n    other).\n-   Normal people can easily re-create the symptoms of DID with minimal\n    suggestion in simulated clinical interviews.\n:::\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   Scientists distinguish between phenomena, which are their systematic\n    observations, and theories, which are their explanations or\n    interpretations of phenomena.\n-   In addition to providing accurate explanations or interpretations,\n    scientific theories have three basic purposes. They organize\n    phenomena, allow people to predict what will happen in new\n    situations, and help generate new research.\n-   Researchers generally consider multiple theories for any set of\n    phenomena. Different theories of the same set of phenomena can be\n    complementary or competing.\n:::\n\n::: exercises\n##### EXERCISES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Practice: Think of at least three different theories to explain the\n    fact that married people tend to report greater levels of happiness\n    than unmarried people.\n2.  Practice: Find a recent article in a professional journal and do two\n    things:\n    -   Identify the primary phenomenon of interest.\n    -   Identify the theory or theories used to explain or interpret\n        that phenomenon.\n3.  Discussion: Can a theory be useful even if it is inaccurate? How?\n:::\n\n## The Variety of Theories in Psychology\n\n::: learningobjectives\n##### LEARNING OBJECTIVES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Describe three dimensions along which theories in psychology vary.\n2.  Give examples of several different types of theories in psychology.\n:::\n\nResearchers in psychology have found that many different types of\ntheories can help them to organize phenomena, predict what will happen\nin new situations, and generate new research. It is important for\nbeginning researchers to be aware of the different types so that they\nrecognize theories when they see them in the research literature. (They\nare not always clearly labeled as \"theories.\") It is also important for\nthem to see that some types of theories are well within their ability to\nunderstand, use, and even construct. In this section, we look at the\nvariety of psychological theories in terms of three important\ndimensions: formality, scope, and theoretical approach.\n\n### Formality {.unnumbered}\n\nPsychological theories vary widely in their [formality]---the extent to\nwhich the components of the theory and the relationships among them are\nspecified clearly and in detail. At the informal end of this dimension\nare theories that consist of simple verbal descriptions of a few\nimportant components and relationships. The habituation theory of\nexpressive-writing effects on health is relatively informal in this\nsense. So is the drive theory of social facilitation and inhibition. At\nthe more precise, formal end of this dimension are theories that are\nexpressed in terms of mathematical equations or computer programs.\n\n::: fyi\n##### Formal Theories in Psychology {.unnumbered}\n\nPeople who are not familiar with scientific psychology are sometimes\nsurprised to learn that psychological theories can take the form of\nmathematical equations and computer programs. The following formal\ntheories are among the best known and most successful in the field.\n\n-   **ACT-R.** A comprehensive theory of human cognition that is akin to\n    a programming language, within which more specific models can be\n    created.\n-   **Prospect theory.** A formal theory of decision making under\n    uncertainty. Psychologist Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Prize in\n    economics based in part on prospect theory.\n-   **Rescorla-Wagner model.** A theory of classical conditioning that\n    features an equation describing how the strength of the association\n    between unconditioned and conditioned stimuli changes when the two\n    are paired.\n:::\n\nBoth informal and formal theories have their place in psychological\nresearch. Informal theories tend to be easier to create and to\nunderstand but less precise in their predictions, which can make them\nmore difficult to test. They are especially appropriate, however, in the\nearly stages of research when the phenomena of interest have not yet\nbeen described in detail. Formal theories tend to be more difficult to\ncreate and to understand---sometimes requiring a certain amount of\nmathematical or computer programming background---but they also tend to\nbe more precise in their predictions and therefore easier to test. They\nare especially appropriate in the later stages of research when the\nphenomena of interest have been described in detail\n\n### Scope {.unnumbered}\n\nTheories in psychology also vary widely in their [scope]---the number\nand diversity of the phenomena they explain or interpret. Many early\npsychological theories were extremely broad in that they attempted to\ninterpret essentially all human behavior. Freud and his followers, for\nexample, applied his theory not only to understanding psychological\ndisorders but also to slips of the tongue and other everyday errors,\ndreaming, sexuality, art, politics, and even civilization itself\n[@fine1990history]. Such theories have fallen out of favor in scientific\npsychology, however, because they tend to be imprecise and difficult to\ntest. In addition, they have not been particularly successful at\norganizing or predicting the range and complexity of human behavior at\nthe level of detail that scientific researchers usually seek.\n\nStill, contemporary theories in psychology can vary in their scope. At\nthe broad end of this dimension are theories that apply to many diverse\nphenomena. Cognitive dissonance theory, for example, assumes that when\npeople hold inconsistent beliefs, this creates mental discomfort that\nthey are motivated to reduce by changing one or both of the beliefs.\nThis theory has been applied to a wide variety of phenomena, including\nthe persistence of irrational beliefs and behaviors (e.g., smoking), the\neffectiveness of certain persuasion and sales techniques (e.g., asking\nfor a small favor before asking for a big one), and even placebo\neffects. At the narrow end of this dimension are theories that apply to\na small number of closely related phenomena. Consider, for example, a\nvery specific quantitative ability called subitizing. This refers to\npeople's ability to quickly and accurately perceive the number of\nobjects in a scene without counting them---as long as the number is four\nor fewer. Several theories have been proposed to explain subitizing.\nAmong them is the idea that small numbers of objects are associated with\neasily recognizable patterns. For example, people know immediately that\nthere are three objects in a scene because the three objects tend to\nform a \"triangle\" and it is this pattern that is quickly perceived\n[@logan2003subitizing].\n\nAs with informal and formal theories, both broad and narrow theories\nhave their place in psychological research. Broad theories organize more\nphenomena but tend to be less formal and less precise in their\npredictions. Narrow theories organize fewer phenomena but tend to be\nmore formal and more precise in their predictions.\n\n### Theoretical Approach {.unnumbered}\n\nIn addition to varying in formality and scope, theories in psychology\nvary widely in the kinds of theoretical ideas they are constructed from.\nWe will refer to this as the [theoretical approach].\n\n[Functional theories](#functional-theory) explain psychological\nphenomena in terms of their function or purpose. For example, one\nprominent theory of repeated self-injury (e.g., cutting) is that people\ndo it because it produces a short-term reduction in the intensity of\nnegative emotions that they are feeling [@huband2009understanding]. Note\nthat this theory does not focus on how this happens, but on the function\nof self-injury for the people who engage in it. Theories from the\nperspective of evolutionary psychology also tend to be\nfunctional---assuming that human behavior has evolved to solve specific\nadaptive problems faced by our distant ancestors. Consider the\nphenomenon of sex differences in human mating strategies\n[@buss1993sexual]. Men are somewhat more likely than women to seek\nshort-term partners and to value physical attractiveness over material\nresources in a mate. Women are somewhat more likely than men to seek\nlong-term partners and to value material resources over physical\nattractiveness in a mate. But why? The standard evolutionary theory\nholds that because the male investment in becoming a parent is\nrelatively small, men reproduce more successfully by seeking several\nshort-term partners who are young and healthy (which is signaled by\nphysical attractiveness). But because the female investment in becoming\na parent is quite large, women reproduce more successfully by seeking a\nlong-term partner who has resources to contribute to raising the child.\n\n[Mechanistic theories](#mechanistic-theory), on the other hand, focus on\nspecific variables, structures, and processes, and how they interact to\nproduce the phenomena. The drive theory of social facilitation and\ninhibition and the multistore model of human memory are mechanistic\ntheories in this sense. Figure 4.4 \"Simplified Representation of One\nContemporary Theory of Hypochondriasis\" represents another example---a\ncontemporary cognitive theory of hypochondriasis---an extreme form of\nhealth anxiety in which people misinterpret ordinary bodily symptoms\n(e.g., headaches) as signs of a serious illness (e.g., a brain tumor;\n@williams2004psychopathology). This theory specifies several key\nvariables and the relationships among them. Specifically, people who are\nhigh in the personality trait of neuroticism (also called negative\nemotionality) start to pay excessive attention to negative health\ninformation---especially if they have had a significant illness\nexperience as a child (e.g., a seriously ill parent). This attention to\nnegative health information then leads to health anxiety and\nhypochondriasis, especially among people who are low in effortful\ncontrol, which is the ability to shift attention away from negative\nthoughts and feelings.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A simplified representation of one contemporary theory of hypochondriasis. This theory focuses on key variables and the relationships among them.](images/theory/hypo.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nMechanistic theories can also be expressed in terms of biological\nstructures and processes. With advances in genetics and neuroscience,\nsuch theories are becoming increasingly common in psychology. For\nexample, researchers are currently constructing and testing theories\nthat specify the brain structures associated with the storage and\nrehearsal of information in the short-term store, the transfer of\ninformation to the long-term store, and so on. Theories of psychological\ndisorders are also increasingly likely to focus on biological\nmechanisms. Schizophrenia, for example, has been explained in terms of\nseveral biological theories, including theories that focus on genetics,\nneurotransmitters, brain structures, and even prenatal exposure to\ninfections.\n\nFinally, there are also theoretical approaches that provide organization\nwithout necessarily providing a functional or mechanistic explanation.\nThese include [stage theories](#stage-theory), which specify a series of\nstages that people pass through as they develop or adapt to their\nenvironment. Famous stage theories include Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of\nneeds and Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development.\n[Typologies](#typology) provide organization by categorizing people or\nbehavior into distinct types. These include theories that identify\nseveral basic emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, anger,\nand disgust), several distinct types of intelligence (e.g., spatial,\nlinguistic, mathematical, kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, and\nintrapersonal), and distinct types of personalities (e.g., Type A vs.\nType B).\n\nResearchers in psychology have found that there is a place for all these\ntheoretical approaches. In fact, multiple approaches are probably\nnecessary to provide a complete understanding of any set of phenomena. A\ncomplete understanding of emotions, for example, is likely to require\nidentifying the basic emotions that people experience, explaining why we\nhave those emotions, and describing how those emotions work in terms of\nunderlying psychological and biological variables, structures, and\nprocesses.\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAY {.unnumbered}\n\n-   Theories in psychology vary widely in terms of their formality,\n    scope, and theoretical approach.

Describe several ways to incorporate theory into your own research.\n:::\n\nWe have now seen what theories are, what they are for, and the variety\nof forms that they take in psychological research. In this section we\nlook more closely at how researchers actually use them. We begin with a\ngeneral description of how researchers test and revise their theories,\nand we end with some practical advice for beginning researchers who want\nto incorporate theory into their research.\n\n### Theory Testing and Revision {.unnumbered}\n\n#### Overview {.unnumbered}\n\nThe primary way that scientific researchers use theories is sometimes\ncalled the [hypothetico-deductive method] (although this term is much\nmore likely to be used by philosophers of science than by scientists\nthemselves). A researcher begins with a set of phenomena and either\nconstructs a theory to explain or interpret them or chooses an existing\ntheory to work with. He or she then makes a prediction about some new\nphenomenon that should be observed if the theory is correct. Again, this\nprediction is called a hypothesis. The researcher then conducts an\nempirical study to test the hypothesis. Finally, he or she reevaluates\nthe theory in light of the new results and revises it if necessary. This\nprocess is usually conceptualized as a cycle because the researcher can\nthen derive a new hypothesis from the revised theory, conduct a new\nempirical study to test the hypothesis, and so on. As Figure\n\\@ref(fig:hypothetico) shows, this approach meshes nicely with the model\nof scientific research in psychology presented earlier in the\nbook---creating a more detailed model of \"theoretically motivated\" or\n\"theory-driven\" research.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Hypothetico-deductive method combined with the general model of scientific research in psychology. Together they form a model of theoretically motivated research.](images/theory/hypothetico.png){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAs an example, let us return to Zajonc's research on social facilitation\nand inhibition. He started with a somewhat contradictory pattern of\nresults from the research literature. He then constructed his drive\ntheory, according to which being watched by others while performing a\ntask causes physiological arousal, which increases an organism's\ntendency to make the dominant response. This leads to social\nfacilitation for well-learned tasks and social inhibition for poorly\nlearned tasks. He now had a theory that organized previous results in a\nmeaningful way---but he still needed to test it. He hypothesized that if\nhis theory was correct, he should observe that the presence of others\nimproves performance in a simple laboratory task but inhibits\nperformance in a difficult version of the very same laboratory task. To\ntest this hypothesis, one of the studies he conducted used cockroaches\nas subjects [@zajonc1969social]. The cockroaches ran either down a\nstraight runway (an easy task for a cockroach) or through a cross-shaped\nmaze (a difficult task for a cockroach) to escape into a dark chamber\nwhen a light was shined on them. They did this either while alone or in\nthe presence of other cockroaches in clear plastic \"audience boxes.\"\nZajonc found that cockroaches in the straight runway reached their goal\nmore quickly in the presence of other cockroaches, but cockroaches in\nthe cross-shaped maze reached their goal more slowly when they were in\nthe presence of other cockroaches. Thus he confirmed his hypothesis and\nprovided support for his drive theory.\n\n#### Constructing or Choosing a Theory {.unnumbered}\n\nAlong with generating research questions, constructing theories is one\nof the more creative parts of scientific research. But as with all\ncreative activities, success requires preparation and hard work more\nthan anything else. To construct a good theory, a researcher must know\nin detail about the phenomena of interest and about any existing\ntheories based on a thorough review of the literature. The new theory\nmust provide a coherent explanation or interpretation of the phenomena\nof interest and have some advantage over existing theories. It could be\nmore formal and therefore more precise, broader in scope, more\nparsimonious, or it could take a new perspective or theoretical\napproach. If there is no existing theory, then almost any theory can be\na step in the right direction.\n\nAs we have seen, formality, scope, and theoretical approach are\ndetermined in part by the nature of the phenomena to be interpreted. But\nthe researcher's interests and abilities play a role too. For example,\nconstructing a theory that specifies the neural structures and processes\nunderlying a set of phenomena requires specialized knowledge and\nexperience in neuroscience (which most professional researchers would\nacquire in college and then graduate school). But again, many theories\nin psychology are relatively informal, narrow in scope, and expressed in\nterms that even a beginning researcher can understand and even use to\nconstruct his or her own new theory.\n\nIt is probably more common, however, for a researcher to start with a\ntheory that was originally constructed by someone else---giving due\ncredit to the originator of the theory. This is another example of how\nresearchers work collectively to advance scientific knowledge. Once they\nhave identified an existing theory, they might derive a hypothesis from\nthe theory and test it or modify the theory to account for some new\nphenomenon and then test the modified theory.\n\n#### Deriving Hypotheses {.unnumbered}\n\nAgain, a hypothesis is a prediction about a new phenomenon that should\nbe observed if a particular theory is accurate. Theories and hypotheses\nalways have this *if-then* relationship. \"*If* drive theory is correct,\n*then* cockroaches should run through a straight runway faster, and a\nbranching runway more slowly, when other cockroaches are present.\"\nAlthough hypotheses are usually expressed as statements, they can always\nbe rephrased as questions. \"Do cockroaches run through a straight runway\nfaster when other cockroaches are present?\" Thus deriving hypotheses\nfrom theories is an excellent way of generating interesting research\nquestions.\n\nBut how do researchers derive hypotheses from theories? One way is to\ngenerate a research question using the techniques discussed in the\nchapter \"Getting Started in Research\" and then ask whether any theory\nimplies an answer to that question. For example, you might wonder\nwhether expressive writing about positive experiences improves health as\nmuch as expressive writing about traumatic experiences. Although this is\nan interesting question on its own, you might then ask whether the\nhabituation theory---the idea that expressive writing causes people to\nhabituate to negative thoughts and feelings---implies an answer. In this\ncase, it seems clear that if the habituation theory is correct, then\nexpressive writing about positive experiences should not be effective\nbecause it would not cause people to habituate to negative thoughts and\nfeelings. A second way to derive hypotheses from theories is to focus on\nsome component of the theory that has not yet been directly observed.\nFor example, a researcher could focus on the process of\nhabituation---perhaps hypothesizing that people should show fewer signs\nof emotional distress with each new writing session.\n\nAmong the very best hypotheses are those that distinguish between\ncompeting theories. For example, Norbert Schwarz and his colleagues\nconsidered two theories of how people make judgments about themselves,\nsuch as how assertive they are [@schwarz1991ease]. Both theories held\nthat such judgments are based on relevant examples that people bring to\nmind. However, one theory was that people base their judgments on the\nnumber of examples they bring to mind and the other was that people base\ntheir judgments on how easily they bring those examples to mind. To test\nthese theories, the researchers asked people to recall either six times\nwhen they were assertive (which is easy for most people) or 12 times\n(which is difficult for most people). Then they asked them to judge\ntheir own assertiveness. Note that the number-of-examples theory implies\nthat people who recalled 12 examples should judge themselves to be more\nassertive because they recalled more examples, but the ease-of-examples\ntheory implies that participants who recalled six examples should judge\nthemselves as more assertive because recalling the examples was easier.\nThus the two theories made opposite predictions so that only one of the\npredictions could be confirmed. The surprising result was that\nparticipants who recalled fewer examples judged themselves to be more\nassertive---providing particularly convincing evidence in favor of the\nease-of-retrieval theory over the number-of-examples theory.\n\n#### Evaluating and Revising Theories {.unnumbered}\n\nIf a hypothesis is confirmed in a systematic empirical study, then the\ntheory has been strengthened. Not only did the theory make an accurate\nprediction, but there is now a new phenomenon that the theory accounts\nfor. If a hypothesis is disconfirmed in a systematic empirical study,\nthen the theory has been weakened. It made an inaccurate prediction, and\nthere is now a new phenomenon that it does not account for.\n\nAlthough this seems straightforward, there are some complications.\nFirst, confirming a hypothesis can strengthen a theory but it can never\nprove a theory. In fact, scientists tend to avoid the word \"prove\" when\ntalking and writing about theories. One reason for this is that there\nmay be other plausible theories that imply the same hypothesis, which\nmeans that confirming the hypothesis strengthens all those theories\nequally. A second reason is that it is always possible that another test\nof the hypothesis or a test of a new hypothesis derived from the theory\nwill be disconfirmed. This is a version of the famous philosophical\n\"problem of induction.\" One cannot definitively prove a general\nprinciple (e.g., \"All swans are white.\") just by observing confirming\ncases (e.g., white swans)---no matter how many. It is always possible\nthat a disconfirming case (e.g., a black swan) will eventually come\nalong. For these reasons, scientists tend to think of theories---even\nhighly successful ones---as subject to revision based on new and\nunexpected observations.\n\nA second complication has to do with what it means when a hypothesis is\ndisconfirmed. According to the strictest version of the\nhypothetico-deductive method, disconfirming a hypothesis disproves the\ntheory it was derived from. In formal logic, the premises \"if *A* then\n*B*\" and \"not *B*\" necessarily lead to the conclusion \"not *A.*\" If *A*\nis the theory and *B* is the hypothesis (\"if *A* then *B*\"), then\ndisconfirming the hypothesis (\"not *B*\") must mean that the theory is\nincorrect (\"not *A*\"). In practice, however, scientists do not give up\non their theories so easily. One reason is that one disconfirmed\nhypothesis could be a fluke or it could be the result of a faulty\nresearch design. Perhaps the researcher did not successfully manipulate\nthe independent variable or measure the dependent variable. A\ndisconfirmed hypothesis could also mean that some unstated but\nrelatively minor assumption of the theory was not met. For example, if\nZajonc had failed to find social facilitation in cockroaches, he could\nhave concluded that drive theory is still correct but it applies only to\nanimals with sufficiently complex nervous systems.\n\nThis does not mean that researchers are free to ignore disconfirmations\nof their theories. If they cannot improve their research designs or\nmodify their theories to account for repeated disconfirmations, then\nthey eventually abandon their theories and replace them with ones that\nare more successful.\n\n### Incorporating Theory Into Your Research {.unnumbered}\n\nIt should be clear from this chapter that theories are not just \"icing\non the cake\" of scientific research; they are a basic ingredient. If you\ncan understand and use them, you will be much more successful at reading\nand understanding the research literature, generating interesting\nresearch questions, and writing and conversing about research. Of\ncourse, your ability to understand and use theories will improve with\npractice. But there are several things that you can do to incorporate\ntheory into your research right from the start.\n\nThe first thing is to distinguish the phenomena you are interested in\nfrom any theories of those phenomena. Beware especially of the tendency\nto \"fuse\" a phenomenon to a commonsense theory of it. For example, it\nmight be tempting to describe the negative effect of cell phone usage on\ndriving ability by saying, \"Cell phone usage distracts people from\ndriving.\" Or it might be tempting to describe the positive effect of\nexpressive writing on health by saying, \"Dealing with your emotions\nthrough writing makes you healthier.\" In both of these examples,\nhowever, a vague commonsense explanation (distraction, \"dealing with\"\nemotions) has been fused to the phenomenon itself. The problem is that\nthis gives the impression that the phenomenon has already been\nadequately explained and closes off further inquiry into precisely why\nor how it happens.\n\nAs another example, researcher Jerry Burger and his colleagues were\ninterested in the phenomenon that people are more willing to comply with\na simple request from someone with whom they are familiar\n[@burger2001effect]. A beginning researcher who is asked to explain why\nthis is the case might be at a complete loss or say something like,\n\"Well, because they are *familiar* with them.\" But digging just a bit\ndeeper, Burger and his colleagues realized that there are several\npossible explanations. Among them are that complying with people we know\ncreates positive feelings, that we anticipate needing something from\nthem in the future, and that we like them more and follow an automatic\nrule that says to help people we like.\n\nThe next thing to do is turn to the research literature to identify\nexisting theories of the phenomena you are interested in. Remember that\nthere will usually be more than one plausible theory. Existing theories\nmay be complementary or competing, but it is essential to know what they\nare. If there are no existing theories, you should come up with two or\nthree of your own---even if they are informal and limited in scope. Then\nget in the habit of describing the phenomena you are interested in,\nfollowed by the two or three best theories of it. Do this whether you\nare speaking or writing about your research. When asked what their\nresearch was about, for example, Burger and his colleagues could have\nsaid something like the following:\n\nIt's about the fact that we're more likely to comply with requests from\npeople we know \\[the phenomenon\\]. This is interesting because it could\nbe because it makes us feel good \\[Theory 1\\], because we think we might\nget something in return \\[Theory 2\\], or because we like them more and\nhave an automatic tendency to comply with people we like \\[Theory 3\\].\n\nAt this point, you may be able to derive a hypothesis from one of the\ntheories. At the very least, for each research question you generate,\nyou should ask what each plausible theory implies about the answer to\nthat question. If one of them implies a particular answer, then you may\nhave an interesting hypothesis to test. Burger and colleagues, for\nexample, asked what would happen if a request came from a stranger whom\nparticipants had sat next to only briefly, did not interact with, and\nhad no expectation of interacting with in the future. They reasoned that\nif familiarity created liking, and liking increased people's tendency to\ncomply (Theory 3), then this situation should still result in increased\nrates of compliance (which it did). If the question is interesting but\nno theory implies an answer to it, this might suggest that a new theory\nneeds to be constructed or that existing theories need to be modified in\nsome way. These would make excellent points of discussion in the\nintroduction or discussion of an American Psychological Association\n(APA) style research report or research presentation.\n\nWhen you do write your research report or plan your presentation, be\naware that there are two basic ways that researchers usually include\ntheory. The first is to raise a research question, answer that question\nby conducting a new study, and then offer one or more theories (usually\nmore) to explain or interpret the results. This format works well for\napplied research questions and for research questions that existing\ntheories do not address. The second way is to describe one or more\nexisting theories, derive a hypothesis from one of those theories, test\nthe hypothesis in a new study, and finally reevaluate the theory. This\nformat works well when there is an existing theory that addresses the\nresearch question---especially if the resulting hypothesis is surprising\nor conflicts with a hypothesis derived from a different theory.\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   Working with theories is not \"icing on the cake.\" It is a basic\n    ingredient of psychological research.\n-   Like other scientists, psychologists use the hypothetico-deductive\n    method. They construct theories to explain or interpret phenomena\n    (or work with existing theories), derive hypotheses from their\n    theories, test the hypotheses, and then reevaluate the theories in\n    light of the new results.\n-   There are several things that even beginning researchers can do to\n    incorporate theory into their research. These include clearly\n    distinguishing phenomena from theories, knowing about existing\n    theories, constructing one's own simple theories, using theories to\n    make predictions about the answers to research questions, and\n    incorporating theories into one's writing and speaking.\n:::\n\n::: exercises\n##### EXERCISE {.unnumbered}\n\n1.
