One widely\ncited estimate is that women speak 20,000 words per day on average and\nmen speak only 7,000. Is it true? A group of psychologists led by Matias\nMehl decided to find out. They checked to see if anyone had actually\ntried to count the daily number of words spoken by women and men. No one\nhad. So these researchers conducted a study in which female and male\ncollege students (369 in all) wore audio recorders while they went about\ntheir lives. The result? The women spoke an average of 16,215 words per\nday and the men spoke an average of 15,669---an extremely small\ndifference that could easily be explained by chance. In an article in\nthe journal Science, these researchers summed up their findings as\nfollows: \"We therefore conclude, on the basis of available empirical\nevidence, that the widespread and highly publicized stereotype about\nfemale talkativeness is unfounded\" [@mehl2007women].\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Although many people believe that women are more talkative than men, scientific research on college students suggests that there is no overall difference. *Photo by Eliott Reyna on Unsplash.*](images/science-of-psych/mehl.jpeg){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Photo of five young adults walking down a sidewalk, laughing and talking.' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPsychology is usually defined as the scientific study of human behavior\nand mental processes, and this example illustrates the features that\nmake it scientific. In this chapter, we look closely at these features,\nintroduce a model of scientific research in psychology, and address\nseveral basic questions that students often have about it. Who conducts\nscientific research in psychology? Why? Does scientific psychology tell\nus anything that common sense does not? Why should I bother to learn the\nscientific approach---especially if I want to be a clinical psychologist\nand not a researcher? These are extremely good questions, by the way,\nand answering them now will provide a solid foundation for learning the\nrest of the material in this book.\n\n## Understanding Science\n\n::: learningobjectives\n##### LEARNING OBJECTIVES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Define science.\n2.  Describe the three fundamental features of science.\n3.  Explain why psychology is a science.\n4.  Define pseudoscience and give some examples.\n:::\n\n### What Is Science? {.unnumbered}\n\nSome people are surprised to learn that psychology is a [science]. They\ngenerally agree that astronomy, biology, and chemistry are sciences but\nwonder what psychology has in common with these other fields. Before\nanswering this question, however, it is worth reflecting on what\nastronomy, biology, and chemistry have in common with *each other*. It\nis clearly not their subject matter. Astronomers study celestial bodies,\nbiologists study living organisms, and chemists study matter and its\nproperties. It is also not the equipment and techniques that they use.\nFew biologists would know what to do with a radio telescope, for\nexample, and few chemists would know how to track a moose population in\nthe wild. For these and other reasons, philosophers and scientists who\nhave thought deeply about this question have concluded that what the\nsciences have in common is a general approach to understanding the\nnatural world. Psychology is a science because it takes this same\ngeneral approach to understanding one aspect of the natural world: human\nbehavior.\n\n### Features of Science {.unnumbered}\n\nThe general scientific approach has three fundamental features\n[@stanovich2013think]. The first is [systematic empiricism]. Empiricism\nrefers to learning based on observation, and scientists learn about the\nnatural world systematically, by carefully planning, making, recording,\nand analyzing observations of it. As we will see, logical reasoning and\neven creativity play important roles in science too, but scientists are\nunique in their insistence on checking their ideas about the way the\nworld is against their systematic observations. Notice, for example,\nthat Mehl and his colleagues did not trust other people's stereotypes or\neven their own informal observations. Instead, they systematically\nrecorded, counted, and compared the number of words spoken by a large\nsample of women and men. Furthermore, when their systematic observations\nturned out to conflict with people's stereotypes, they trusted their\nsystematic observations.\n\nThe second feature of the scientific approach---which follows in a\nstraightforward way from the first---is that it is concerned with\n[empirical questions](#empirical-question). These are questions about\nthe way the world actually is and, therefore, can be answered by\nsystematically observing it. The question of whether women talk more\nthan men is empirical in this way. Either women really do talk more than\nmen or they do not, and this can be determined by systematically\nobserving how much women and men actually talk. There are many\ninteresting and important questions that are not empirically testable\nand that science cannot answer. Among them are questions about\nvalues---whether things are good or bad, just or unjust, or beautiful or\nugly, and how the world *ought* to be. So although the question of\nwhether a stereotype is accurate or inaccurate is an empirically\ntestable one that science can answer, the question of whether it is\nwrong for people to hold inaccurate stereotypes is not. Similarly, the\nquestion of whether criminal behavior has a genetic component is an\nempirical question, but the question of what should be done with people\nwho commit crimes is not. It is especially important for researchers in\npsychology to be mindful of this distinction.\n\nThe third feature of science is that it creates [public knowledge].\nAfter asking their empirical questions, making their systematic\nobservations, and drawing their conclusions, scientists publish their\nwork. This usually means writing an article for publication in a\nprofessional journal, in which they put their research question in the\ncontext of previous research, describe in detail the methods they used\nto answer their question, and clearly present their results and\nconclusions. Publication is an essential feature of science for two\nreasons. One is that science is a social process---a large-scale\ncollaboration among many researchers distributed across both time and\nspace. Our current scientific knowledge of most topics is based on many\ndifferent studies conducted by many different researchers who have\nshared their work with each other over the years. The second is that\npublication allows science to be self-correcting. Individual scientists\nunderstand that despite their best efforts, their methods can be flawed\nand their conclusions incorrect. Publication allows others in the\nscientific community to detect and correct these errors so that, over\ntime, scientific knowledge increasingly reflects the way the world\nactually is.\n\n### Science Versus Pseudoscience {.unnumbered}\n\n[Pseudoscience] refers to activities and beliefs that are claimed to be\nscientific by their proponents---and may *appear* to be scientific at\nfirst glance---but are not. Consider the theory of biorhythms (not to be\nconfused with sleep cycles or other biological cycles that do have a\nscientific basis). The idea is that people's physical, intellectual, and\nemotional abilities run in cycles that begin when they are born and\ncontinue until they die. The physical cycle has a period of 23 days, the\nintellectual cycle a period of 33 days, and the emotional cycle a period\nof 28 days. So, for example, if you had the option of when to schedule\nan exam, you would want to schedule it for a time when your intellectual\ncycle will be at a high point. The theory of biorhythms has been around\nfor more than 100 years, and you can find numerous popular books and\nwebsites about biorhythms, often containing impressive and\nscientific-sounding terms like *sinusoidal wave* and *bioelectricity*.\nThe problem with biorhythms, however, is that there is no good reason to\nthink they exist [@hines1998comprehensive].\n\nA set of beliefs or activities can be said to be pseudoscientific if (a)\nits adherents claim or imply that it is scientific but (b) it lacks one\nor more of the three features of science. It might lack systematic\nempiricism. Either there is no relevant scientific research or, as in\nthe case of biorhythms, there is relevant scientific research but it is\nignored. It might also lack public knowledge. People who promote the\nbeliefs or activities might claim to have conducted scientific research\nbut never publish that research in a way that allows others to evaluate\nit.\n\nA set of beliefs and activities might also be pseudoscientific because\nit does not address empirical questions. The philosopher Karl Popper was\nespecially concerned with this idea [@popper2014conjectures]. He argued\nmore specifically that any scientific claim must be expressed in such a\nway that there are observations that would---if they were made---count\nas evidence against the claim. In other words, scientific claims must be\n[falsifiable]. The claim that women talk more than men is falsifiable\nbecause systematic observations could reveal either that they do talk\nmore than men or that they do not. As an example of an unfalsifiable\nclaim, consider that many people who study extrasensory perception (ESP)\nand other psychic powers claim that such powers can disappear when they\nare observed too closely. This makes it so that no possible observation\nwould count as evidence against ESP. If a careful test of a\nself-proclaimed psychic showed that she predicted the future at\nbetter-than-chance levels, this would be consistent with the claim that\nshe had psychic powers. But if she failed to predict the future at\nbetter-than-chance levels, this would also be consistent with the claim\nbecause her powers can supposedly disappear when they are observed too\nclosely.\n\nWhy should we concern ourselves with pseudoscience? There are at least\nthree reasons. One is that learning about pseudoscience helps bring the\nfundamental features of science---and their importance---into sharper\nfocus. A second is that biorhythms, psychic powers, astrology, and many\nother pseudoscientific beliefs are widely held and are promoted on the\nInternet, on television, and in books and magazines. Learning what makes\nthem pseudoscientific can help us to identify and evaluate such beliefs\nand practices when we encounter them. A third reason is that many\npseudosciences purport to explain some aspect of human behavior and\nmental processes, including biorhythms, astrology, graphology\n(handwriting analysis), and magnet therapy for pain control. It is\nimportant for students of psychology to distinguish their own field\nclearly from this \"pseudopsychology.\"\n\n::: fyi\n##### The Skeptic's Dictionary {.unnumbered}\n\nAn excellent source for information on pseudoscience is The Skeptic's\nDictionary (http://www.skepdic.com). Among the pseudoscientific beliefs\nand practices you can learn about are the following:\n\n-   **Cryptozoology.** The study of \"hidden\" creatures like Bigfoot, the\n    Loch Ness monster, and the chupacabra.\n-   **Pseudoscientific psychotherapies.** Past-life regression,\n    rebirthing therapy, and bioscream therapy, among others.\n-   **Homeopathy.** The treatment of medical conditions using natural\n    substances that have been diluted sometimes to the point of no\n    longer being present.\n-   **Pyramidology.** Odd theories about the origin and function of the\n    Egyptian pyramids (e.g., that they were built by extraterrestrials)\n    and the idea that pyramids in general have healing and other special\n    powers.\n:::\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   Science is a general way of understanding the natural world. Its\n    three fundamental features are systematic empiricism, empirical\n    questions, and public knowledge.\n\n-   Psychology is a science because it takes the scientific approach to\n    understanding human behavior.\n\n-   Pseudoscience refers to beliefs and activities that are claimed to\n    be scientific but lack one or more of the three features of science.\n    It is important to distinguish the scientific approach to\n    understanding human behavior from the many pseudoscientific\n    approaches.\n:::\n\n::: exercises\n##### EXERCISES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Discussion: People sometimes suggest that psychology cannot be a\n    science because either (a) human behavior cannot be predicted with\n    perfect accuracy or (b) much of its subject matter (e.g., thoughts\n    and feelings) cannot be observed directly. Do you agree or disagree\n    with each of these ideas? Why?\n\n2.  Practice: List three empirical questions about human behavior. List\n    three nonempirical questions about human behavior.\n\n3.  Discussion: Consider the following psychological claim. \"People's\n    choice of spouse is strongly influenced by their perception of their\n    own parents. Some choose a spouse who is similar in some way to one\n    of their parents. Others choose a spouse who is different from one\n    of their parents.\" Is this claim falsifiable? Why or why not?\n:::\n\n## Scientific Research in Psychology\n\n::: learningobjectives\n##### LEARNING OBJECTIVES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Describe a general model of scientific research in psychology and\n    give specific examples that fit the model.\n2.  Explain who conducts scientific research in psychology and why they\n    do it.\n3.  Distinguish between basic research and applied research.\n:::\n\n### A Model of Scientific Research in Psychology {.unnumbered}\n\nFigure \\@ref(fig:scientificmethod) presents a more specific model of\nscientific research in psychology. The researcher (who more often than\nnot is really a small group of researchers) formulates a research\nquestion, conducts a study designed to answer the question, analyzes the\nresulting data, draws conclusions about the answer to the question, and\npublishes the results so that they become part of the research\nliterature. Because the research literature is one of the primary\nsources of new research questions, this process can be thought of as a\ncycle. New research leads to new questions, which lead to new research,\nand so on. Figure \\@ref(fig:scientificmethod) also indicates that\nresearch questions can originate outside of this cycle either with\ninformal observations or with practical problems that need to be solved.\nBut even in these cases, the researcher would start by checking the\nresearch literature to see if the question had already been answered and\nto refine it based on what previous research had already found.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A simple model of scientific research in psychology.](images/science-of-psych/scientificmethod.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='A circular flow chart with arrows going from Research Literature to Research Questions, then to Empirical Study, then to Data Analysis, then to Conclusions, and then back to Research Literature. An additional arrow points from Research Questions to Research Literature. From outside the circle an arrow points to Research Questions from Informal Observations/ Practical Problems.' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe research by Mehl and his colleagues is described nicely by this\nmodel. Their question---whether women are more talkative than men---was\nsuggested to them both by people's stereotypes and by published claims\nabout the relative talkativeness of women and men. When they checked the\nresearch literature, however, they found that this question had not been\nadequately addressed in scientific studies. They conducted a careful\nempirical study, analyzed the results (finding very little difference\nbetween women and men), and published their work so that it became part\nof the research literature. The publication of their article is not the\nend of the story, however, because their work suggests many new\nquestions (about the reliability of the result, about potential cultural\ndifferences, etc.) that will likely be taken up by them and by other\nresearchers inspired by their work.\n\nAs another example, consider that as cell phones became more widespread\nduring the 1990s, people began to wonder whether, and to what extent,\ncell phone use had a negative effect on driving. Many psychologists\ndecided to tackle this question scientifically [@collet2010phoning]. It\nwas clear from previously published research that engaging in a simple\nverbal task impairs performance on a perceptual or motor task carried\nout at the same time, but no one had studied the effect specifically of\ncell phone use on driving. Under carefully controlled conditions, these\nresearchers compared people's driving performance while using a cell\nphone with their performance while not using a cell phone, both in the\nlab and on the road. They found that people's ability to detect road\nhazards, reaction time, and control of the vehicle were all impaired by\ncell phone use. Each new study was published and became part of the\ngrowing research literature on this topic.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scientific research has confirmed that cell phone use impairs a variety of driving behaviors. *Photo by Alexandre Boucher on Unsplash.*](images/science-of-psych/cell.jpeg){fig-align='center' fig-alt='A photograph of a man holding a cell phone to his ear while driving.' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Who Conducts Scientific Research in Psychology? {.unnumbered}\n\nScientific research in psychology is generally conducted by people with\ndoctoral degrees (usually the [doctor of philosophy, or\nPHD](#doctor-of-philosophy)) and master's degrees in psychology and\nrelated fields, often supported by research assistants with bachelor's\ndegrees or other relevant training. Some of them work for government\nagencies (e.g., the National Institute of Mental Health), for nonprofit\norganizations (e.g., the American Cancer Society), or in the private\nsector (e.g., in product development). However, the majority of them are\ncollege and university faculty, who often collaborate with their\ngraduate and undergraduate students. Although some researchers are\ntrained and licensed as clinicians---especially those who conduct\nresearch in clinical psychology---the majority are not. Instead, they\nhave expertise in one or more of the many other subfields of psychology:\nbehavioral neuroscience, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology,\npersonality psychology, social psychology, and so on. Doctoral-level\nresearchers might be employed to conduct research full-time or, like\nmany college and university faculty members, to conduct research in\naddition to teaching classes and serving their institution and community\nin other ways.\n\nOf course, people also conduct research in psychology because they enjoy\nthe intellectual and technical challenges involved and the satisfaction\nof contributing to scientific knowledge of human behavior. You might\nfind that you enjoy the process too. If so, your college or university\nmight offer opportunities to get involved in ongoing research as either\na research assistant or a participant. Of course, you might find that\nyou do not enjoy the process of conducting scientific research in\npsychology. But at least you will have a better understanding of where\nscientific knowledge in psychology comes from, an appreciation of its\nstrengths and limitations, and an awareness of how it can be applied to\nsolve practical problems in psychology and everyday life.\n\n### The Broader Purposes of Scientific Research in Psychology {.unnumbered}\n\nPeople have always been curious about the natural world, including\nthemselves and their behavior. (In fact, this is probably why you are\nstudying psychology in the first place.) Science grew out of this\nnatural curiosity and has become the best way to achieve detailed and\naccurate knowledge. Keep in mind that most of the phenomena and theories\nthat fill psychology textbooks are the products of scientific research.\nIn a typical introductory psychology textbook, for example, one can\nlearn about specific cortical areas for language and perception,\nprinciples of classical and operant conditioning, biases in reasoning\nand judgment, and people's surprising tendency to obey authority. And\nscientific research continues because what we know right now only\nscratches the surface of what we can know.\n\nScientific research is often classified as being either basic or\napplied. [Basic research] in psychology is conducted primarily for the\nsake of achieving a more detailed and accurate understanding of human\nbehavior, without necessarily trying to address any particular practical\nproblem. The research of Mehl and his colleagues falls into this\ncategory. [Applied research] is conducted primarily to address some\npractical problem. Research on the effects of cell phone use on driving,\nfor example, was prompted by safety concerns and has led to the\nenactment of laws to limit this practice. Although the distinction\nbetween basic and applied research is convenient, it is not always\nclear-cut. For example, basic research on sex differences in\ntalkativeness could eventually have an effect on how marriage therapy is\npracticed, and applied research on the effect of cell phone use on\ndriving could produce new insights into basic processes of perception,\nattention, and action.\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   Research in psychology can be described by a simple cyclical model.\n    A research question based on the research literature leads to an\n    empirical study, the results of which are published and become part\n    of the research literature.\n-   Scientific research in psychology is conducted mainly by people with\n    doctoral degrees in psychology and related fields, most of whom are\n    college and university faculty members. They do so for professional\n    and for personal reasons, as well as to contribute to scientific\n    knowledge about human behavior.\n-   Basic research is conducted to learn about human behavior for its\n    own sake, and applied research is conducted to solve some practical\n    problem. Both are valuable, and the distinction between the two is\n    not always clear-cut.\n:::\n\n::: exercises\n##### EXERCISES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Practice: Find a description of an empirical study in a professional\n    journal or in one of the scientific psychology blogs. Then write a\n    brief description of the research in terms of the cyclical model\n    presented here. One or two sentences for each part of the cycle\n    should suffice.\n2.  Practice: Based on your own experience or on things you have already\n    learned about psychology, list three basic research questions and\n    three applied research questions of interest to you.\n:::\n\n## Science and Common Sense\n\n::: learningobjectives\n##### LEARNING OBJECTIVES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Explain the limitations of common sense when it comes to achieving a\n    detailed and accurate understanding of human behavior.\n2.  Give several examples of common sense or folk psychology that are\n    incorrect.\n3.  Define skepticism and its role in scientific psychology.\n:::\n\n### Can We Rely on Common Sense? {.unnumbered}\n\nSome people wonder whether the scientific approach to psychology is\nnecessary. Can we not reach the same conclusions based on common sense\nor intuition? Certainly we all have intuitive beliefs about people's\nbehavior, thoughts, and feelings---and these beliefs are collectively\nreferred to as [folk psychology]. Although much of our folk psychology\nis probably reasonably accurate, it is clear that much of it is not. For\nexample, most people believe that anger can be relieved by \"letting it\nout\"---perhaps by punching something or screaming loudly. Scientific\nresearch, however, has shown that this approach tends to leave people\nfeeling more angry, not less [@bushman2002does]. Likewise, most people\nbelieve that no one would confess to a crime that he or she had not\ncommitted, unless perhaps that person was being physically tortured. But\nagain, extensive empirical research has shown that false confessions are\nsurprisingly common and occur for a variety of reasons\n[@kassin2004psychology].\n\n::: fyi\n##### Some Great Myths {.unnumbered}\n\nIn 50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology, psychologist Scott Lilienfeld\nand colleagues discuss several widely held commonsense beliefs about\nhuman behavior that scientific research has shown to be incorrect\n[@lilienfeld2010five].Here is a short list.\n\n-   \"People use only 10% of their brain power.\"\n-   \"Most people experience a midlife crisis in their 40's or 50's.\"\n-   \"Students learn best when teaching styles are matched to their\n    learning styles.\"\n-   \"Low self-esteem is a major cause of psychological problems.\"\n-   \"Psychiatric admissions and crimes increase during full moons.\"\n:::\n\n### How Could We Be So Wrong? {.unnumbered}\n\nHow can so many of our intuitive beliefs about human behavior be so\nwrong? Notice that this is a psychological question, and it just so\nhappens that psychologists have conducted scientific research on it and\nidentified many contributing factors [@gilovich2008we]. One is that\nforming detailed and accurate beliefs requires powers of observation,\nmemory, and analysis to an extent that we do not naturally possess. It\nwould be nearly impossible to count the number of words spoken by the\nwomen and men we happen to encounter, estimate the number of words they\nspoke per day, average these numbers for both groups, and compare\nthem---all in our heads. This is why we tend to rely on mental shortcuts\nin forming and maintaining our beliefs. For example, if a belief is\nwidely shared---especially if it is endorsed by \"experts\"---and it makes\nintuitive sense, we tend to assume it is true. This is compounded by the\nfact that we then tend to focus on cases that confirm our intuitive\nbeliefs and not on cases that disconfirm them. This is called\n[confirmation bias]. For example, once we begin to believe that women\nare more talkative than men, we tend to notice and remember talkative\nwomen and silent men but ignore or forget silent women and talkative\nmen. We also hold incorrect beliefs in part because it would be nice if\nthey were true. For example, many people believe that calorie-reducing\ndiets are an effective long-term treatment for obesity, yet a thorough\nreview of the scientific evidence has shown that they are not\n[@mann2007medicare]. People may continue to believe in the effectiveness\nof dieting in part because it gives them hope for losing weight if they\nare obese or makes them feel good about their own \"self-control\" if they\nare not.\n\nScientists---especially psychologists---understand that they are just as\nsusceptible as anyone else to intuitive but incorrect beliefs. This is\nwhy they cultivate an attitude of [skepticism]. Being skeptical does not\nmean being cynical or distrustful, nor does it mean questioning every\nbelief or claim one comes across (which would be impossible anyway).\nInstead, it means pausing to consider alternatives and to search for\nevidence---especially systematically collected empirical evidence---when\nthere is enough at stake to justify doing so. Imagine that you read a\nmagazine article that claims that giving children a weekly allowance is\na good way to help them develop financial responsibility. This is an\ninteresting and potentially important claim (especially if you have\nkids). Taking an attitude of skepticism, however, would mean pausing to\nask whether it might be instead that receiving an allowance merely\nteaches children to spend money---perhaps even to be more materialistic.\nTaking an attitude of skepticism would also mean asking what evidence\nsupports the original claim. Is the author a scientific researcher? Is\nany scientific evidence cited? If the issue was important enough, it\nmight also mean turning to the research literature to see if anyone else\nhad studied it.\n\nBecause there is often not enough evidence to fully evaluate a belief or\nclaim, scientists also cultivate [tolerance for uncertainty]. They\naccept that there are many things that they simply do not know. For\nexample, it turns out that there is no scientific evidence that\nreceiving an allowance causes children to be more financially\nresponsible, nor is there any scientific evidence that it causes them to\nbe materialistic. Although this kind of uncertainty can be problematic\nfrom a practical perspective---for example, making it difficult to\ndecide what to do when our children ask for an allowance---it is\nexciting from a scientific perspective. If we do not know the answer to\nan interesting and empirically testable question, science may be able to\nprovide the answer.\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   People's intuitions about human behavior, also known as folk\n    psychology, often turn out to be wrong. This is one primary reason\n    that psychology relies on science rather than common sense.\n-   Researchers in psychology cultivate certain critical-thinking\n    attitudes. One is skepticism. They search for evidence and consider\n    alternatives before accepting a claim about human behavior as true.\n    Another is tolerance for uncertainty. They withhold judgment about\n    whether a claim is true or not when there is insufficient evidence\n    to decide.\n:::\n\n::: exercises\n##### EXERCISES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.

Define the clinical practice of psychology and distinguish it from\n    the science of psychology.\n2.  Explain how science is relevant to clinical practice.\n3.  Define the concept of an empirically supported treatment and give\n    some examples.\n:::\n\nAgain, psychology is the scientific study of behavior and mental\nprocesses. But it is also the application of scientific research to\n\"help people, organizations, and communities function better\" (American\nPsychological Association, 2011). By far the most common and widely\nknown application is the [clinical practice of psychology]---the\ndiagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and related problems.\nLet us use the term *clinical practice* broadly to refer to the\nactivities of clinical and counseling psychologists, school\npsychologists, marriage and family therapists, licensed clinical social\nworkers, and others who work with people individually or in small groups\nto identify and solve their psychological problems. It is important to\nconsider the relationship between scientific research and clinical\npractice because many students are especially interested in clinical\npractice, perhaps even as a career.\n\nThe main point is that psychological disorders and other behavioral\nproblems are part of the natural world. This means that questions about\ntheir nature, causes, and consequences are empirically testable and\ntherefore subject to scientific study. As with other questions about\nhuman behavior, we cannot rely on our intuition or common sense for\ndetailed and accurate answers. Consider, for example, that dozens of\npopular books and thousands of websites claim that adult children of\nalcoholics have a distinct personality profile, including low\nself-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, and difficulties with intimacy.\nAlthough this sounds plausible, scientific research has demonstrated\nthat adult children of alcoholics are no more likely to have these\nproblems than anybody else [@lilienfeld2010five]. Similarly, questions\nabout whether a particular psychotherapy works are empirically testable\nquestions that can be answered by scientific research. If a new\npsychotherapy is an effective treatment for depression, then systematic\nobservation should reveal that depressed people who receive this\npsychotherapy improve more than a similar group of depressed people who\ndo not receive this psychotherapy (or who receive some alternative\ntreatment). Treatments that have been shown to work in this way are\ncalled [empirically supported\ntreatments](#empirically-supported-treatment).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The effectiveness of various forms of psychotherapy—for example, cognitive behavioral therapy for depression—can be determined by scientific research. *Photo by Priscilla Du Preez on Unsplash.*](images/science-of-psych/therapy.jpeg){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Photo of two people sitting near each other with their hands folded in their laps.

These include many\nforms of psychotherapy, which can be as effective as standard drug\ntherapies. Among the forms of psychotherapy with strong empirical\nsupport are the following:\n\n-   **Cognitive behavioral therapy.** For depression, panic disorder,\n    bulimia nervosa, and posttraumatic stress disorder.\n-   **Exposure therapy.** For posttraumatic stress disorder.\n-   **Behavioral therapy.** For depression.\n-   **Behavioral couples therapy.** For alcoholism and substance abuse.\n-   **Exposure therapy with response prevention.** For\n    obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n-   **Family therapy.** For schizophrenia.\n\nFor a more complete list, see the following website, which is maintained\nby Division 12 of the American Psychological Association, the Society\nfor Clinical Psychology: https://div12.org/treatments/.\n:::\n\nMany in the clinical psychology community have argued that their field\nhas not paid enough attention to scientific research---for example, by\nfailing to use empirically supported treatments---and have suggested a\nvariety of changes in the way clinicians are trained and treatments are\nevaluated and put into practice. Others believe that these claims are\nexaggerated and the suggested changes are unnecessary\n[@norcross2006evidence]. On both sides of the debate, however, there is\nagreement that a scientific approach to clinical psychology is essential\nif the goal is to diagnose and treat psychological problems based on\ndetailed and accurate knowledge about those problems and the most\neffective treatments for them. So not only is it important for\nscientific research in clinical psychology to continue, but it is also\nimportant for clinicians who never conduct a scientific study themselves\nto be scientifically literate so that they can read and evaluate new\nresearch and make treatment decisions based on the best available\nevidence.\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   The clinical practice of psychology---the diagnosis and treatment of\n    psychological problems---is one important application of the\n    scientific discipline of psychology.\n-   Scientific research is relevant to clinical practice because it\n    provides detailed and accurate knowledge about psychological\n    problems and establishes whether treatments are effective.\n:::\n\n::: exercises\n##### EXERCISES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Discussion: Some clinicians argue that what they do is an \"art form\"\n    based on intuition and personal experience and therefore cannot be\n    evaluated scientifically. Write a paragraph about how satisfied you\n    would be with such a clinician and why from each of three\n    perspectives:\n\n-   a potential client of the clinician\n-   a judge who must decide whether to allow the clinician to testify as\n    an expert witness in a child abuse case\n-   an insurance company representative who must decide whether to\n    reimburse the clinician for his or her services\n\n2.  Practice: Create a short list of questions that a client could ask a\n    clinician to determine whether he or she pays sufficient attention\n    to scientific research.\n:::\n\n## Glossary\n\n##### applied research {.unnumbered}\n\nScientific research that is conducted primarily to solve some practical\nproblem.\n\n##### basic research {.unnumbered}\n\nScientific research that is conducted primarily for the sake of learning\nsomething new.\n\n##### clinical practice of psychology {.unnumbered}\n\nThe diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and related\nproblems.\n\n##### confirmation bias {.unnumbered}\n\nThe tendency to notice and remember evidence that is consistent with\nwhat we already believe, as opposed to evidence that is inconsistent\nwith what we already believe.\n\n##### doctor of philosophy {#doctor-of-philosophy .unnumbered}\n\nThe highest degree in most academic fields, including psychology.\nScientific researchers in psychology typically have this degree.
