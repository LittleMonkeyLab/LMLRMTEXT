Over the last five years, what is the average time to complete a\n    degree for undergrads in the University of California system?\n3.  Does a new drug reduce the severity of symptoms in patients with\n    panic disorder?\n\nEach research question refers to a target [population]. In the first\nquestion, the target population is all Americans over the age of 18.\nOftentimes, it is not feasible to collect data for every case in a\npopulation. Collecting data for an entire population is called a\n[census]. A census is difficult because it is too expensive to collect\ndata for the entire population, but it might also be because it is\ndifficult or impossible to identify the entire population of interest!\nInstead, a sample is taken. A [sample] is the data you have. Ideally, a\nsample is a small fraction of the population. For instance, 200\nAmericans adults in the population might be selected, and this sample\ndata may be used to provide an estimate of the population average and to\nanswer the research question.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A sample of 10 selected from a population of 100.](images/sampling/sampling.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='A circle on the left with 100 human figures.

Explain the difference between probability and nonprobability\n    sampling.\n2.  Describe the major types of probability sampling.\n:::\n\nEssentially all psychological research involves sampling---selecting a\nsample to study from the population of interest. Sampling falls into two\nbroad categories. [Probability sampling] occurs when the researcher can\nspecify the probability that each member of the population will be\nselected for the sample. [Nonprobability sampling] occurs when the\nresearcher cannot specify these probabilities. Most psychological\nresearch involves nonprobability sampling. Convenience\nsampling---studying individuals who happen to be nearby and willing to\nparticipate---is a very common form of nonprobability sampling used in\npsychological research.\n\nSurvey researchers, however, are much more likely to use some form of\nprobability sampling. This is because the goal of most survey research\nis to make accurate estimates about what is true in a particular\npopulation, and these estimates are most accurate when based on a\nprobability sample. For example, it is important for survey researchers\nto base their estimates of election outcomes---which are often decided\nby only a few percentage points---on probability samples of likely\nregistered voters.\n\nCompared with nonprobability sampling, probability sampling requires a\nvery clear specification of the population, which of course depends on\nthe research questions to be answered. The population might be all\nregistered voters in the state of Arkansas, all American consumers who\nhave purchased a car in the past year, women in the United States over\n40 years old who have received a mammogram in the past decade, or all\nthe alumni of a particular university. Once the population has been\nspecified, probability sampling requires a [sampling frame]. This is\nessentially a list of all the members of the population from which to\nselect the respondents. Sampling frames can come from a variety of\nsources, including telephone directories, lists of registered voters,\nand hospital or insurance records. In some cases, a map can serve as a\nsampling frame, allowing for the selection of cities, streets, or\nhouseholds.\n\nThere are a variety of different probability sampling methods. [Simple\nrandom sampling] is done in such a way that each individual in the\npopulation has an equal probability of being selected for the sample\n(Figure \\@ref(fig:simple)). This could involve putting the names of all\nindividuals in the sampling frame into a hat, mixing them up, and then\ndrawing out the number needed for the sample. Given that most sampling\nframes take the form of computer files, random sampling is more likely\nto involve computerized sorting or selection of respondents. A common\napproach in telephone surveys is random-digit dialing, in which a\ncomputer randomly generates phone numbers from among the possible phone\nnumbers within a given geographic area.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Example of simple random sampling. Simple random sampling was used to randomly select the 18 cases (denoted with filled-in dots).](07-sampling_files/figure-html/simple-1.png){fig-alt='Box shows a population of dots (i.e., individuals) where a handful of the dots have been sampled randomly.' width=95%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA common alternative to simple random sampling is [stratified random\nsampling], in which the population is divided into different subgroups\nor \"strata\" (usually based on demographic characteristics) and then a\nrandom sample is taken from each \"stratum\" (Figure\n\\@ref(fig:stratified)). Stratified random sampling can be used to select\na sample in which the proportion of respondents in each of various\nsubgroups matches the proportion in the population. For example, because\nabout 12.5% of the US population is Black, stratified random sampling\ncan be used to ensure that a survey of 1,000 American adults includes\nabout 125 Black respondents. Stratified random sampling can also be used\nto sample extra respondents from particularly small subgroups---allowing\nvalid conclusions to be drawn about those subgroups. For example,\nbecause Asian Americans make up a fairly small percentage of the US\npopulation (about 4.5%), a simple random sample of 1,000 American adults\nmight include too few Asian Americans to draw any conclusions about them\nas distinct from any other subgroup. If this is important to the\nresearch question, however, then stratified random sampling could be\nused to ensure that enough Asian American respondents are included in\nthe sample to draw valid conclusions about Asian Americans as a whole.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Example of stratified random sampling. Cases were first grouped into strata, or subgroups, then simple random sampling was employed to randomly select 20% of cases within each stratum. The resulting sample reflects the proportion of cases in each subgroup.](07-sampling_files/figure-html/stratified-1.png){fig-alt='The box shows the same population of dots but grouped in such a way that there are six strata.  From each stratum 20% of the dots (i.e., individuals) are randomly selected.' width=95%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYet another type of probability sampling is [cluster sampling], in which\nlarger clusters of individuals are randomly sampled and then individuals\nwithin each cluster are randomly sampled (Figure \\@ref(fig:cluster)).\nFor example, to select a sample of small-town residents in the United\nStates, a researcher might randomly select several small towns and then\nrandomly select several individuals within each town. Cluster sampling\nis especially useful for surveys that involve face-to-face interviewing\nbecause it minimizes the amount of traveling that the interviewers must\ndo. For example, instead of traveling to 200 small towns to interview\n200 residents, a research team could travel to 10 small towns and\ninterview 20 residents of each. The National Comorbidity Survey was done\nusing a form of cluster sampling.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Example of cluster sampling. Data were binned into nine clusters, three of these clusters were sampled, and all observations within these three clusters were included in the sample.](07-sampling_files/figure-html/cluster-1.png){fig-alt='Dots are grouped into clusters, three clusters are selected, and every dot (i.e., all individuals) from each of the three clusters are sampled.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Sample Size {.unnumbered}\n\nHow large does a sample need to be? In general, this depends on two\nfactors. One is the level of confidence in the result that the\nresearcher wants. The larger the sample, the less any statistic will be\naffected by random error that might cause researchers to misestimate the\ncorresponding value in the population. The other factor is the budget of\nthe study. Larger samples provide greater confidence, but they take more\ntime, effort, and money to obtain. In the August 2022 issue of\n*Psychological Science*, the total sample size for individual studies\nincluded 28 participants in a multi-trial lab study [@ohata2022] and 953\nin an online study [@Schaumberg2022].\n\n::: fyi\n##### Sample Size and Population Size {.unnumbered}\n\nWhy are a samples of 100 to 1,000 considered to be adequate for most\nsurvey research---even when the population is much larger than that?\nConsider, for example, that a sample of only 1,000 registered voters is\ngenerally considered a good sample of the roughly 120 million registered\nvoters in the US population---even though it includes only about 0.0008%\nof the population! The answer is a bit surprising.\n\nOne part of the answer is that a statistic based on a larger sample will\ntend to be closer to the population value and that this can be\ncharacterized mathematically. Imagine, for example, that in a sample of\nregistered voters, exactly 50% say they intend to vote for the\nincumbent. If there are 100 voters in this sample, then there is a 95%\nchance that the true percentage in the population is between 40 and 60.\nBut if there are 1,000 voters in the sample, then there is a 95% chance\nthat the true percentage in the population is between 47 and 53.\nAlthough this \"95% confidence interval\" continues to shrink as the\nsample size increases, it does so at a slower rate. For example, if\nthere are 2,000 voters in the sample, then this only reduces the 95%\nconfidence interval to 48 to 52. In many situations, the small increase\nin confidence beyond a sample size of 1,000 is not considered to be\nworth the additional time, effort, and money.\n\nAnother part of the answer---and perhaps the more surprising part---is\nthat confidence intervals depend only on the size of the sample and not\non the size of the population. So a sample of 1,000 would produce a 95%\nconfidence interval of 47 to 53 regardless of whether the population\nsize was a hundred thousand, a million, or a hundred million.\n:::\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   Survey research usually involves probability sampling, in which each\n    member of the population has a known probability of being selected\n    for the sample.\n-   Types of probability sampling include simple random sampling,\n    stratified random sampling, and cluster sampling.\n:::\n\n::: exercises\n##### EXERCISE {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Discussion: If possible, identify an appropriate sampling frame for\n    each of the following populations. If there is no appropriate\n    sampling frame, explain why.\n    a.  students at a particular college or university\n    b.  adults living in the state of Nevada\n    c.  households in Little Rock, Arkansas\n    d.  people with low self-esteem\n:::\n\n## Sampling Bias\n\n::: learningobjectives\n##### LEARNING OBJECTIVES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Define sampling bias in general and nonresponse bias in particular.\n2.  List some techniques that can be used to increase the response rate\n    and reduce nonresponse bias.\n:::\n\n### Sampling Bias and Nonresponse Bias {.unnumbered}\n\nProbability sampling was developed in large part to address the issue of\nsampling bias. [Sampling bias] occurs when a sample is selected in such\na way that it is not representative of the entire population and\ntherefore produces inaccurate results. This was the reason that the\n*Literary Digest* straw poll was so far off in its prediction of the\n1936 presidential election. The mailing lists used came largely from\ntelephone directories and lists of registered automobile owners, which\noverrepresented wealthier people, who were more likely to vote for\nLandon. Gallup was successful because he knew about this bias and found\nways to sample less wealthy people as well.\n\nThere is one form of sampling bias that even careful random sampling is\nsubject to. It is almost never the case that everyone selected for the\nsample actually responds to the survey. Some may have died or moved\naway, and others may decline to participate because they are too busy,\nare not interested in the survey topic, or do not participate in surveys\non principle. If these survey nonresponders differ from survey\nresponders in systematic ways, then this can produce [nonresponse bias].\nFor example, in a mail survey on alcohol consumption, researcher\nVivienne Lahaut and colleagues found that only about half the sample\nresponded after the initial contact and two follow-up reminders\n[@lahaut2002non]. The danger here is that the half who responded might\nhave different patterns of alcohol consumption than the half who did\nnot, which could lead to inaccurate conclusions on the part of the\nresearchers. So to test for nonresponse bias, the researchers later made\nunannounced visits to the homes of a subset of the\nnonresponders---coming back up to five times if they did not find them\nat home. They found that the original nonresponders included an\nespecially high proportion of abstainers (nondrinkers), which meant that\ntheir estimates of alcohol consumption based only on the original\nresponders were too high.\n\nAlthough there are methods for statistically correcting for nonresponse\nbias, they are based on assumptions about the nonresponders---for\nexample, that they are more similar to late responders than to early\nresponders---which may not be correct. For this reason, the best\napproach to minimizing nonresponse bias is to minimize the number of\nnonresponders---that is, to maximize the response rate. There is a large\nresearch literature on the factors that affect survey response rates\n[@groves2011survey]. In general, in-person interviews have the highest\nresponse rates, followed by telephone surveys, and then mail and\nInternet surveys. Among the other factors that increase response rates\nare sending potential respondents a short prenotification message\ninforming them that they will be asked to participate in a survey in the\nnear future and sending simple follow-up reminders to nonresponders\nafter a few weeks. The perceived length and complexity of the survey\nalso makes a difference, which is why it is important to keep survey\nquestionnaires as short, simple, and on topic as possible. Finally,\noffering an incentive---especially cash---is a reliable way to increase\nresponse rates.\n\n### Anecdotal Evidence {.unnumbered}\n\nConsider the following possible responses to the three research\nquestions at the start of this chapter:\n\n1.  A popular American YouTuber posted a video revealing that despite\n    his many followers, he doesn't have anyone he could call a real\n    friend, so the average number of close friends for American adults\n    must be very low.\n2.  I met two students who took more than 7 years to graduate from\n    campuses in the University of California system, so it must take\n    longer to graduate from University of California schools than from\n    many other colleges.\n3.  My friend's sister had a severe panic attack after they gave her a\n    new drug, so the drug must not work.\n\nEach conclusion is based on data. However, there are two problems.\nFirst, the data only represent one or two cases. Second, and more\nimportantly, it is unclear whether these cases are actually\nrepresentative of the population. Data collected in this haphazard\nfashion are called [anecdotal evidence]. Be careful of data collected in\na haphazard fashion. Such evidence may be true and verifiable, but it\nmay only represent extraordinary cases and therefore not be a good\nrepresentation of the population.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![In February 2010, some media pundits cited one large snowstorm as evidence against global warming. As comedian Jon Stewart pointed out, “It is one storm, in one region of one country.” *Photo by Flow Clark on Unsplash.*](images/sampling/snow.jpeg){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Person walking through a snowy city street.' width=35%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnecdotal evidence typically is composed of unusual cases that we recall\nbased on their striking characteristics. For instance, we are more\nlikely to remember the two people we met who took 7 years to graduate\nthan the six others who graduated in four years. Instead, of looking at\nthe most unusual cases, we should examine a sample of many cases that\nbetter represent the population.\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   Sampling bias occurs when a sample is selected in such a way that it\n    is not representative of the population and therefore produces\n    inaccurate results.\n-   The most pervasive form of sampling bias is nonresponse bias, which\n    occurs when people who do not respond to the survey differ in\n    important ways from people who do respond.\n-   The best way to minimize nonresponse bias is to maximize the\n    response rate by prenotifying respondents, sending them reminders,\n    constructing questionnaires that are short and easy to complete, and\n    offering incentives.\n:::\n\n::: exercises\n##### EXERCISES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.
