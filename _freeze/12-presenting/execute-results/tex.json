There is still one\nmore step in the process of conducting scientific research. It is time\nto add your research to the literature so that others can learn from it\nand build on it. Remember that science is a social process---a\nlarge-scale collaboration among many researchers distributed across\nspace and time. For this reason, it could be argued that unless you make\nyour research public in some form, you are not really engaged in science\nat all.\n\nIn this chapter, we look at how to present your research effectively. We\nbegin with a discussion of American Psychological Association (APA)\nstyle---the primary approach to writing taken by researchers in\npsychology and related fields. Then we consider how to write an\nAPA-style empirical research report. Finally, we look at some of the\nmany other ways in which researchers present their work, including\nreview and theoretical articles, theses and other student papers, and\ntalks and posters at professional meetings.\n\n## American Psychological Association (APA) Style\n\n::: learningobjectives\n##### LEARNING OBJECTIVES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Define APA style and list several of its most important\n    characteristics.\n2.  Identify three levels of APA style and give examples of each.\n3.  Identify multiple sources of information about APA style.\n:::\n\n### What Is APA Style? {.unnumbered}\n\n[APA style] is a set of guidelines for writing in psychology and related\nfields. These guidelines are set down in the [Publication Manual of the\nAmerican Psychological Association] [@american2020publication]. The\nPublication Manual originated in 1929 as a short journal article that\nprovided basic standards for preparing manuscripts to be submitted for\npublication [@bentley1929instructions]. It was later expanded and\npublished as a book by the association and is now in its seventh\nedition. The primary purpose of APA style is to facilitate scientific\ncommunication by promoting clarity of expression and by standardizing\nthe organization and content of research articles and book chapters. It\nis easier to write about research when you know what information to\npresent, the order in which to present it, and even the style in which\nto present it. Likewise, it is easier to read about research when it is\npresented in familiar and expected ways.\n\nAPA style is best thought of as a \"genre\" of writing that is appropriate\nfor presenting the results of psychological research---especially in\nacademic and professional contexts. It is not synonymous with \"good\nwriting\" in general. You would not write a literary analysis for an\nEnglish class, even if it were based on psychoanalytic concepts, in APA\nstyle. You would write it in Modern Language Association (MLA) style\ninstead. And you would not write a newspaper article, even if it were\nabout a new breakthrough in behavioral neuroscience, in APA style. You\nwould write it in Associated Press (AP) style instead. At the same time,\nyou would not write an empirical research report in MLA style, in AP\nstyle, or in the style of a romance novel, an e-mail to a friend, or a\nshopping list. You would write it in APA style. Part of being a good\nwriter in general is adopting a style that is appropriate to the writing\ntask at hand, and for writing about psychological research, this is APA\nstyle.\n\n### The Levels of APA Style {.unnumbered}\n\nBecause APA style consists of a large number and variety of\nguidelines---the *Publication Manual* is over 300 pages long---it can be\nuseful to think about it in terms of three basic levels. The first is\nthe overall [organization] of an article (which is covered in Chapter 2\nof the *Publication Manual*). Empirical research reports, in particular,\nhave several distinct sections that always appear in the same order:\n\n1.  **Title page.** Presents the article title and author names and\n    affiliations.\n2.  **Abstract.** Summarizes the research.\n3.  **Introduction.** Describes previous research and the rationale for\n    the current study.\n4.  **Method.** Describes how the study was conducted.\n5.  **Results.** Describes the results of the study.\n6.  **Discussion.** Summarizes the study and discusses its implications.\n7.  **References.** Lists the references cited throughout the article.\n\nThe second level of APA style can be referred to as [high-level style]\n(covered in Chapters 3-6 of the *Publication Manual*), which includes\nguidelines for the clear expression of ideas. There are two important\nthemes here. One is that APA-style writing is formal rather than\ninformal. It adopts a tone that is appropriate for communicating with\nprofessional colleagues---other researchers and practitioners---who\nshare an interest in the topic. Beyond this shared interest, however,\nthese colleagues are not necessarily similar to the writer or to each\nother. A graduate student in California might be writing an article that\nwill be read by a young psychotherapist in New York City and a respected\nprofessor of psychology in Tokyo. Thus formal writing avoids slang,\ncontractions, pop culture references, humor, and other elements that\nwould be acceptable in talking with a friend or in writing informally.\n\nThe second theme of high-level APA style is that it is straightforward.\nThis means that it communicates ideas as simply and clearly as possible,\nputting the focus on the ideas themselves and not on how they are\ncommunicated. Thus APA-style writing minimizes literary devices such as\nmetaphor, imagery, irony, suspense, and so on. Again, humor is kept to a\nminimum. Sentences are short and direct. Technical terms must be used,\nbut they are used to improve communication, not simply to make the\nwriting sound more \"scientific.\" For example, if participants immersed\ntheir hands in a bucket of ice water, it is better just to write this\nthan to write that they \"were subjected to a pain-inducement apparatus.\"\nAt the same time, however, there is no better way to communicate that a\nbetween-subjects design was used than to use the term \"between-subjects\ndesign.\"\n\n::: fyi\n##### APA Style and the Values of Psychology {.unnumbered}\n\nRobert Madigan and his colleagues have argued that APA style has a\npurpose that often goes unrecognized [@madigan1995language].\nSpecifically, it promotes psychologists' scientific values and\nassumptions. From this perspective, many features of APA style that at\nfirst seem arbitrary actually make good sense. Following are several\nfeatures of APA-style writing and the scientific values or assumptions\nthey reflect.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|APA style feature                                                                 |Scientific value or assumption                                                                                                                |\n|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|There are very few direct quotations of other researchers.                        |The phenomena and theories of psychology are objective and do not depend on the specific words a particular researcher used to describe them. |\n|Criticisms are directed at other researchers’ work but not at them personally.    |The focus of scientific research is on drawing general conclusions about the world, not on the personalities of particular researchers.       |\n|There are many references and reference citations.                                |Scientific research is a large-scale collaboration among many researchers.                                                                    |\n|Empirical research reports are organized with specific sections in a fixed order. |There is an ideal approach to conducting empirical research in psychology (even if this ideal is not always achieved in actual research).     |\n|Researchers tend to “hedge” their conclusions, e.g., “The results suggest that…”  |Scientific knowledge is tentative and always subject to revision based on new empirical results.                                              |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nAnother important element of high-level APA style is the avoidance of\nlanguage that is biased against particular groups. This is not only to\navoid offending people---why would you want to offend people who are\ninterested in your work?---but also for the sake of scientific\nobjectivity and accuracy. For example, the term *sexual orientation*\nshould be used instead of *sexual preference* because people do not\ngenerally experience their orientation as a \"preference,\" nor is it as\neasily changeable as this term suggests [@herek1991avoiding].\n\nThe general principles for avoiding biased language are fairly simple.\nFirst, be sensitive to labels by avoiding terms that are offensive or\nhave negative connotations. This includes terms that identify people\nwith a disorder or other problem they happen to have. For example,\n*patients with schizophrenia* is better than *schizophrenics.* Second,\nuse more specific terms rather than more general ones. For example,\n*Mexican Americans* is better than *Hispanics* if everyone in the group\nis, in fact, *Mexican American*. Third, avoid objectifying research\nparticipants. Instead, acknowledge their active contribution to the\nresearch. For example, \"The *students completed* the questionnaire\" is\nbetter than \"The *subjects were administered* the questionnaire.\" Note\nthat this principle also makes for clearer, more engaging writing. Table\n\\@ref(tab:bias) shows several more examples that follow these general\nprinciples.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nTable: Examples of avoiding biased language.\n\n|Instead of...                |Use...                                           |\n|:----------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|\n|man, men                     |men and women, people                            |\n|firemen                      |firefighters                                     |\n|homosexuals, gays, bisexuals |lesbians, gay men, bisexual men, bisexual people |\n|minority                     |specific group label (e.g., African American)    |\n|neurotics                    |people scoring high in neuroticism               |\n|special children             |children with learning disabilities              |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nA previous edition of the *Publication Manual* strongly discouraged the\nuse of the term *subjects* (except for nonhumans) and strongly\nencouraged the use of *participants* instead. The current edition,\nhowever, acknowledges that *subjects* can still be appropriate in\nreferring to human participants in areas in which it has traditionally\nbeen used (e.g., basic memory research). But it also encourages the use\nof more specific terms when possible: *college students*, *children*,\n*respondents*, and so on.\n\nThe third level of APA style can be referred to as [low-level style]\n(which is covered in Chapter 6 through Chapter 10 of the *Publication\nManual*.) Low-level style includes all the specific guidelines\npertaining to spelling, grammar, references and reference citations,\nnumbers and statistics, figures and tables, and so on. There are so many\nlow-level guidelines that even experienced professionals need to consult\nthe *Publication Manual* from time to time. Table \\@ref(tab:errors)\ncontains some of the most common types of APA style errors based on an\nanalysis of manuscripts submitted to one professional journal over a\n6-year period [@onwuegbuzie2010evidence]. These errors were committed by\nprofessional researchers but are probably similar to those that students\ncommit the most too.

However, there are also many good websites on APA style, which\ndo an excellent job of presenting the basics for beginning researchers.\nHere are two of them.\n\nAPA Style: http://www.apastyle.apa.org\n\nPurdue Online Writing Lab:\nhttps://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html\n:::\n\n### APA-Style References and Citations {.unnumbered}\n\nBecause science is a large-scale collaboration among researchers,\nreferences to the work of other researchers are extremely important.\nTheir importance is reflected in the extensive and detailed set of rules\nfor formatting and using them.\n\n#### References {.unnumbered}\n\nAt the end of an APA-style article or book chapter is a list that\ncontains [references](#reference) to all the works cited in the text\n(and *only* the works cited in the text). The reference list begins on\nits own page, with the heading \"References\" centered and bolded. The\nreferences themselves are then listed alphabetically according to the\nlast names of the first named author for each citation. (As in the rest\nof an APA-style manuscript, *everything* is double-spaced.) Many\ndifferent kinds of works might be cited in APA-style articles and book\nchapters, including magazine articles, websites, government documents,\nand even television shows. Of course, you should consult the\n*Publication Manual* or Online APA Style Resources for details on how to\nformat them. Here we will focus on formatting references for the three\nmost common kinds of works cited in APA style: journal articles, books,\nand book chapters.\n\n#### Journal Articles {.unnumbered}\n\nFor journal articles, the generic format for a reference is as follows:\n\n> <p class=\"hangingindent\">\n>\n> Author, A. A., Author, B. B., & Author, C. C. (year). Title of\n> article. *Title of Journal*, *xx*, pp--pp.\n> https://doi.org/xx.xxxxxxxxxx\n>\n> </p>\n\nHere is a concrete example:\n\n> <p class=\"hangingindent\">\n>\n> Adair, J. G., & Vohra, N. (2003). The explosion of knowledge,\n> references, and citations: Psychology's unique response to a crisis.\n> *American Psychologist*, *58*, 15--23.\n> https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.58.1.15\n>\n> </p>\n\nThere are several things to notice here. The reference includes a\nhanging indent. That is, the first line of the reference is not indented\nbut all subsequent lines are. The authors' names appear in the same\norder as on the article, which reflects the authors' relative\ncontributions to the research. Only the authors' last names and initials\nappear, and the names are separated by commas with an ampersand (&)\nbetween the last two. This is true even when there are only two authors.\nOnly the first word of the article title is capitalized. The only\nexceptions are for words that are proper nouns or adjectives (e.g.,\n\"Freudian\") or if there is a subtitle, in which case the first word of\nthe subtitle is also capitalized. In the journal title, however, all the\nimportant words are capitalized. The journal title and volume number are\nitalicized. At the very end of the reference is the digital object\nidentifier (DOI), which provides a permanent link to the location of the\narticle on the Internet. Include this if it is available. It can\ngenerally be found in the record for the item on an electronic database\n(e.g., PsycINFO) and is usually displayed on the first page of the\npublished article.\n\n#### Books {.unnumbered}\n\nFor a book, the generic format and a concrete example are as follows:\n\n> <p class=\"hangingindent\">\n>\n> Author, A. A. (year). *Title of book*. Location: Publisher.\n>\n> </p>\n\n> <p class=\"hangingindent\">\n>\n> Milgram, S. (1974). *Obedience to authority: An experimental view*.\n> New York, NY: Harper & Row.\n>\n> </p>\n\n#### Book Chapters {.unnumbered}\n\nFor a chapter in an edited book, the generic format and a concrete\nexample are as follows:\n\n> <p class=\"hangingindent\">\n>\n> Author, A. A., Author, B. B., & Author, C. C. (year). Title of\n> chapter. In A. A. Editor, B. B. Editor, & C. C. Editor (Eds.), *Title\n> of book* (pp. xxx--xxx). Location: Publisher.\n>\n> </p>\n\n> <p class=\"hangingindent\">\n>\n> Lilienfeld, S. O., & Lynn, S. J. (2003). Dissociative identity\n> disorder: Multiple personalities, multiple controversies. In S. O.\n> Lilienfeld, S. J. Lynn, & J. M. Lohr (Eds.), *Science and\n> pseudoscience in clinical psychology* (pp. 109--142). New York, NY:\n> Guilford Press.\n>\n> </p>\n\nNotice that references for books and book chapters are similar to those\nfor journal articles, but there are several differences too. For an\nedited book, the names of the editors appear with their first and middle\ninitials followed by their last names (not the other way around)---with\nthe abbreviation \"Eds.\" (or \"Ed.,\" if there is only one) appearing in\nparentheses immediately after the final editor's name. Only the first\nword of a book title is capitalized (with the exceptions noted for\narticle titles), and the entire title is italicized. For a chapter in an\nedited book, the page numbers of the chapter appear in parentheses after\nthe book title with the abbreviation \"pp.\" Finally, both formats end\nwith the location of publication and the publisher, separated by a\ncolon.\n\n#### Reference Citations {.unnumbered}\n\nWhen you refer to another researcher's idea, you must include a\n[reference citation] (in the text) to the work in which that idea\noriginally appeared and a full reference to that work in the reference\nlist. What counts as an idea that must be cited? In general, this\nincludes phenomena discovered by other researchers, theories they have\ndeveloped, hypotheses they have derived, and specific methods they have\nused (e.g., specific questionnaires or stimulus materials). Citations\nshould also appear for factual information that is not common knowledge\nso that other researchers can check that information for themselves. For\nexample, in an article on the effect of cell phone usage on driving\nability, the writer might cite official statistics on the number of cell\nphone--related accidents that occur each year. Among the ideas that do\nnot need citations are widely shared methodological and statistical\nconcepts (e.g., between-subjects design, *t* test) and statements that\nare so broad that they would be difficult for anyone to argue with\n(e.g., \"Working memory plays a role in many daily activities.\"). Be\ncareful, though, because \"common knowledge\" about human behavior is\noften incorrect. Therefore, when in doubt, find an appropriate reference\nto cite or remove the questionable assertion.\n\nWhen you cite a work in the text of your manuscript, there are two ways\nto do it. Both include only the last names of the authors and the year\nof publication. The first method is to use the authors' last names in\nthe sentence (with no first names or initials) followed immediately by\nthe year of publication in parentheses. Here are some examples:\n\n> Burger (2008) conducted a replication of Milgram's (1963) original\n> obedience study.\n\n> García-Rodicio and Sánchez (2014) studied the persistence of students'\n> misconceptions.\n\nNotice several things. First, the authors' names are treated\ngrammatically as names of people, not as things. It is better to write\n\"a replication of Milgram's (1963) study\" than \"a replication of Milgram\n(1963).\" Second, when there are two authors the names are not separated\nby commas. Third, the word and (rather than an ampersand) is used to\njoin the authors' names. Fourth, the year follows immediately after the\nfinal author's name. An additional point, which is not illustrated in\nthese examples but is illustrated in the sample paper later in this\nchapter, is that the year only needs to be included the first time a\nparticular work is cited in the same paragraph.\n\nThe second way to cite an article or a book chapter is\nparenthetically---including the authors' last names and the year of\npublication in parentheses following the idea that is being credited.\nHere are some examples:\n\n> People can be surprisingly obedient to authority figures (Burger,\n> 2008; Milgram, 1963).\n\n> Informing students of common misconceptions may not be sufficient to\n> repair misunderstandings (García-Rodicio & Sánchez, 2014).\n\nOne thing to notice about such parenthetical citations is that they are\noften placed at the end of the sentence, which minimizes their\ndisruption to the flow of that sentence. In contrast to the first way of\nciting a work, this way always includes the year---even when the\ncitation is given multiple times in the same paragraph. Notice also that\nwhen there are multiple citations in the same set of parentheses, they\nare organized alphabetically by the name of the first author and\nseparated by semicolons.\n\nThere are no strict rules for deciding which of the two citation styles\nto use. Most articles and book chapters contain a mixture of the two. In\ngeneral, however, the first approach works well when you want to\nemphasize the person who conducted the research---for example, if you\nwere comparing the theories of two prominent researchers. It also works\nwell when you are describing a particular study in detail. The second\napproach works well when you are discussing a general idea and\nespecially when you want to include multiple citations for the same\nidea.\n\nThe third most common error in Table \\@ref(tab:errors) has to do with\nthe use of *et al.* This is an abbreviation for the Latin term *et\nalia*, which means \"and others.\" In APA style, if an article or a book\nchapter has more than two authors, your in-text citation should use the\nfirst author's name followed by \"et al.\" Here are some examples:\n\n> Although many people believe that women are more talkative than men,\n> Mehl et al. (2007) found essentially no difference in the number of\n> words spoken by male and female college students.\n\n> There is a strong positive correlation between the number of daily\n> hassles and the number of symptoms people experience (Kanner et al.,\n> 1981).\n\nNotice that there is no comma between the first author's name and \"et\nal.\" Notice also that there is no period after \"et\" but there is one\nafter \"al.\" This is because \"et\" is a complete word and \"al.\" is an\nabbreviation for the word *alia.*\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   APA style is a set of guidelines for writing in psychology. It is\n    the genre of writing that psychologists use to communicate about\n    their research with other researchers and practitioners.\n-   APA style can be seen as having three levels. There is the\n    organization of a research article, the high-level style that\n    includes writing in a formal and straightforward way, and the\n    low-level style that consists of many specific rules of grammar,\n    spelling, formatting of references, and so on.\n-   References and reference citations are an important part of APA\n    style. There are specific rules for formatting references and for\n    citing them in the text of an article.\n:::\n\n::: exercises\n##### EXERCISES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.

Identify the major sections of an APA-style research report and the\n    basic contents of each section.\n2.  Plan and write an effective APA-style research report.\n:::\n\nIn this section, we look at how to write an APA-style [empirical\nresearch report], an article that presents the results of one or more\nnew studies. Recall that the standard sections of an empirical research\nreport provide a kind of outline. Here we consider each of these\nsections in detail, including what information it contains, how that\ninformation is formatted and organized, and tips for writing each\nsection. At the end of this section is a sample APA-style research\nreport that illustrates many of these principles.\n\n### Sections of a Research Report {.unnumbered}\n\n#### Title Page and Abstract {.unnumbered}\n\nAn APA-style research report begins with a [title page]. The title is\ncentered and bolded in the upper half of the page, with each important\nword capitalized. The title should clearly and concisely (in about 12\nwords or fewer) communicate the primary variables and research\nquestions. This sometimes requires a main title followed by a subtitle\nthat elaborates on the main title, in which case the main title and\nsubtitle are separated by a colon. Here are some titles from issues of\nprofessional journals published by the American Psychological\nAssociation.\n\n-   Sex Differences in Coping Styles and Implications for Depressed Mood\n-   Effects of Aging and Divided Attention on Memory for Items and Their\n    Contexts\n-   Computer-Assisted Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Child Anxiety:\n    Results of a Randomized Clinical Trial\n-   Virtual Driving and Risk Taking: Do Racing Games Increase\n    Risk-Taking Cognitions, Affect, and Behavior?\n\nBelow the title are the authors' names and, on the next line, their\ninstitutional affiliation---the university or other institution where\nthe authors worked when they conducted the research. As we have already\nseen, the authors are listed in an order that reflects their\ncontribution to the research. When multiple authors have made equal\ncontributions to the research, they often list their names\nalphabetically or in a randomly determined order.\n\n::: fyi\n##### It's Soooo Cute! {.unnumbered}\n\nHow Informal Should an Article Title Be?\n\nIn some areas of psychology, the titles of many empirical research\nreports are informal in a way that is perhaps best described as \"cute.\"\nThey usually take the form of a play on words or a well-known expression\nthat relates to the topic under study. Here are some examples from the\n*Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*.\n\n-   \"Let's Get Serious: Communicating Commitment in Romantic\n    Relationships\"\n-   \"Through the Looking Glass Clearly: Accuracy and Assumed Similarity\n    in Well-Adjusted Individuals' First Impressions\"\n-   \"Don't Hide Your Happiness! Positive Emotion Dissociation, Social\n    Connectedness, and Psychological Functioning\"\n-   \"Forbidden Fruit: Inattention to Attractive Alternatives Provokes\n    Implicit Relationship Reactance\"\n\nIndividual researchers differ quite a bit in their preference for such\ntitles. Some use them regularly, while others never use them. What might\nbe some of the pros and cons of using cute article titles?\n:::\n\nFor articles that are being submitted for publication, the title page\nalso includes an author note that lists the authors' full institutional\naffiliations, any acknowledgments the authors wish to make to agencies\nthat funded the research or to colleagues who commented on it, and\ncontact information for the authors. For student papers that are not\nbeing submitted for publication---including theses---author notes are\ngenerally not necessary.\n\nThe [abstract] is a summary of the study. It is the second page of the\nmanuscript and is headed with the bolded word *Abstract.* The first line\nis not indented. The abstract presents the research question, a summary\nof the method, the basic results, and the most important conclusions.\nBecause the abstract is usually limited to about 200 words, it can be a\nchallenge to write a good one.\n\n#### Introduction {.unnumbered}\n\nThe [introduction] begins on the third page of the manuscript. The\nheading at the top of this page is the full title of the manuscript,\nbolded and with each important word capitalized as on the title page.\nThe introduction includes three distinct subsections, although these are\ntypically not identified by separate headings. The opening introduces\nthe research question and explains why it is interesting, the literature\nreview discusses relevant previous research, and the closing restates\nthe research question and comments on the method used to answer it.\n\n#### The Opening {.unnumbered}\n\nThe [opening], which is usually a paragraph or two in length, introduces\nthe research question and explains why it is interesting. To capture the\nreader's attention, start with general observations about the topic\nunder study, expressed in ordinary language (not technical\njargon)---observations that are about people and their behavior (not\nabout researchers or their research; @bem2003writing). For example, this\nwould be a poor way to begin a research report:\n\n> Thomas and McDaniel (2007) and Thiede et al. (2011), showed that\n> calibration of metacomprehension is influenced by study-test\n> congruency.\n\nHere's another poor opener (wrong tone; too flowery):\n\n> Over the course of one's academic trials, it is of utmost consequence\n> to make provision for the scrutiny of one's own aptitude-- to wit,\n> what shall constitute the appraisal, and what arduousness will bear\n> out?\n\nThe following would be much better:\n\n> When students prepare for an upcoming exam, it may benefit them to\n> take into consideration the style of the expected test. Consider the\n> following students: Student A always focuses on rote memorization,\n> regardless of exam type; Student B focuses on either rote memorization\n> or conceptual understanding depending on their expectations of the\n> exam.\n\nAfter capturing the reader's attention, the opening should go on to\nintroduce the research question and explain why it is interesting. Will\nthe answer fill a gap in the literature? Will it provide a test of an\nimportant theory? Does it have practical implications? Giving readers a\nclear sense of what the research is about and why they should care about\nit will motivate them to continue reading the literature review---and\nwill help them make sense of it.\n\n::: fyi\n##### Breaking the Rules {.unnumbered}\n\nResearcher Larry Jacoby reported several studies showing that a word\nthat people see or hear repeatedly can seem more familiar even when they\ndo not recall the repetitions---and that this tendency is especially\npronounced among older adults. He opened his article with the following\nhumorous anecdote (Jacoby, 1999).\n\n> A friend whose mother is suffering symptoms of Alzheimer's disease\n> (AD) tells the story of taking her mother to visit a nursing home,\n> preliminary to her mother's moving there. During an orientation\n> meeting at the nursing home, the rules and regulations were explained,\n> one of which regarded the dining room. The dining room was described\n> as similar to a fine restaurant except that tipping was not required.\n> The absence of tipping was a central theme in the orientation lecture,\n> mentioned frequently to emphasize the quality of care along with the\n> advantages of having paid in advance. At the end of the meeting, the\n> friend's mother was asked whether she had any questions. She replied\n> that she only had one question: \"Should I tip?\" (p. 3).\n\nAlthough both humor and personal anecdotes are generally discouraged in\nAPA-style writing, this example is a highly effective way to start\nbecause it both engages the reader and provides an excellent real-world\nexample of the topic under study.\n:::\n\n#### The Literature Review {.unnumbered}\n\nImmediately after the opening comes the [literature review], which\ndescribes relevant previous research on the topic and can be anywhere\nfrom several paragraphs to several pages in length. However, the\nliterature review is not simply a list of past studies. Instead, it\nconstitutes a kind of argument for why the research question is worth\naddressing. By the end of the literature review, readers should be\nconvinced that the research question makes sense and that the present\nstudy is a logical next step in the ongoing research process.\n\nLike any effective argument, the literature review must have some kind\nof structure. For example, it might begin by describing a phenomenon in\na general way along with several studies that demonstrate it, then\ndescribing two or more competing theories of the phenomenon, and finally\npresenting a hypothesis to test one or more of the theories. Or it might\ndescribe one phenomenon, then describe another phenomenon that seems\ninconsistent with the first one, then propose a theory that resolves the\ninconsistency, and finally present a hypothesis to test that theory. In\napplied research, it might describe a phenomenon or theory, then\ndescribe how that phenomenon or theory applies to some important\nreal-world situation, and finally suggest a way to test whether it does,\nin fact, apply to that situation.\n\nLooking at the literature review in this way emphasizes a few things.\nFirst, it is extremely important to start with an outline of the main\npoints that you want to make, organized in the order that you want to\nmake them. The basic structure of your argument, then, should be\napparent from the outline itself. Second, it is important to emphasize\nthe structure of your argument in your writing. One way to do this is to\nbegin the literature review by summarizing your argument even before you\nbegin to make it. \"In this article, I will describe two apparently\ncontradictory phenomena, present a new theory that has the potential to\nresolve the apparent contradiction, and finally present a novel\nhypothesis to test the theory.\" Another way is to open each paragraph\nwith a sentence that summarizes the main point of the paragraph and\nlinks it to the preceding points. These opening sentences provide the\n\"transitions\" that many beginning researchers have difficulty with.\nInstead of beginning a paragraph by launching into a description of a\nprevious study, such as \"Williams (2004) found that...,\" it is better to\nstart by indicating something about why you are describing this\nparticular study. Here are some simple examples:\n\n> Another example of this phenomenon comes from the work of Williams\n> (2004).\n\n> Williams (2004) offers one explanation of this phenomenon.\n\n> An alternative perspective has been provided by Williams (2004).\n\n> We used a method based on the one used by Williams (2004).\n\nFinally, remember that your goal is to construct an argument for why\nyour research question is interesting and worth addressing---not\nnecessarily why your favorite answer to it is correct. In other words,\nyour literature review must be balanced. If you want to emphasize the\ngenerality of a phenomenon, then of course you should discuss various\nstudies that have demonstrated it. However, if there are other studies\nthat have failed to demonstrate it, you should discuss them too. Or if\nyou are proposing a new theory, then of course you should discuss\nfindings that are consistent with that theory. However, if there are\nother findings that are inconsistent with it, again, you should discuss\nthem too. It is acceptable to argue that the *balance* of the research\nsupports the existence of a phenomenon or is consistent with a theory\n(and that is usually the best that researchers in psychology can hope\nfor), but it is not acceptable to *ignore* contradictory evidence.\nBesides, a large part of what makes a research question interesting is\nuncertainty about its answer.\n\n#### The Closing {.unnumbered}\n\nThe [closing] of the introduction---typically the final paragraph or\ntwo---usually includes two important elements. The first is a clear\nstatement of the main research question or hypothesis. This statement\ntends to be more formal and precise than in the opening and is often\nexpressed in terms of operational definitions of the key variables. The\nsecond is a brief overview of the method and some comment on its\nappropriateness. Here, for example, is how @darley1968bystander\nconcluded the introduction to their classic article on the bystander\neffect:\n\n> These considerations lead to the hypothesis that the more bystanders\n> to an emergency, the less likely, or the more slowly, any one\n> bystander will intervene to provide aid. To test this proposition it\n> would be necessary to create a situation in which a realistic\n> \"emergency\" could plausibly occur. Each subject should also be blocked\n> from communicating with others to prevent his getting information\n> about their behavior during the emergency. Finally, the experimental\n> situation should allow for the assessment of the speed and frequency\n> of the subjects' reaction to the emergency. The experiment reported\n> below attempted to fulfill these conditions (p. 378).\n\nThus the introduction leads smoothly into the next major section of the\narticle---the method section.\n\n#### Method {.unnumbered}\n\nThe [method section] is where you describe how you conducted your study.\nAn important principle for writing a method section is that it should be\nclear and detailed enough that other researchers could replicate the\nstudy by following your \"recipe.\" This means that it must describe all\nthe important elements of the study---basic demographic characteristics\nof the participants, how they were recruited, whether they were randomly\nassigned, how the variables were manipulated or measured, how\ncounterbalancing was accomplished, and so on. At the same time, it\nshould avoid irrelevant details such as the fact that the study was\nconducted in Classroom 37B of the Industrial Technology Building or that\nthe questionnaire was double-sided and completed using mechanical\npencils.\n\nThe method section begins immediately after the introduction ends with\nthe heading \"Method\" (not \"Methods\") centered on the page. Immediately\nafter this is the subheading \"Participants,\" left justified and in\nitalics. The participants subsection indicates how many participants\nthere were, the number of women and men, some indication of their age,\nother demographics that may be relevant to the study, and how they were\nrecruited, including any incentives given for participation.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Three ways of organizing an APA-style method.](images/ch11/method.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAfter the participants section, the structure can vary a bit. Figure\n\\@ref(fig:method) shows three common approaches. In the first, the\nparticipants section is followed by a design and procedure subsection,\nwhich describes the rest of the method. This works well for methods that\nare relatively simple and can be described adequately in a few\nparagraphs. In the second approach, the participants section is followed\nby separate design and procedure subsections. This works well when both\nthe design and the procedure are relatively complicated and each\nrequires multiple paragraphs.\n\nWhat is the difference between design and procedure? The design of a\nstudy is its overall structure. What were the independent and dependent\nvariables? Was the independent variable manipulated, and if so, was it\nmanipulated between or within subjects? How were the variables\noperationally defined? The procedure is how the study was carried out.\nIt often works well to describe the procedure in terms of what the\nparticipants did rather than what the researchers did. For example, the\nparticipants gave their informed consent, read a set of instructions,\ncompleted a block of four practice trials, completed a block of 20 test\ntrials, completed two questionnaires, and were debriefed and excused.\n\nIn the third basic way to organize a method section, the participants\nand design subsections are followed by a materials subsection before the\nprocedure subsections. This works well when there are complicated\nmaterials to describe. This might mean multiple questionnaires, written\nvignettes that participants read and respond to, perceptual stimuli, and\nso on. This subsection may have a further level of subsections with\nheadings like \"Questionnaires,\" \"Stimuli,\" and so on.\n\n#### Results {.unnumbered}\n\nThe [results section] is where you present the main results of the\nstudy, including the results of the statistical analyses. Although it\ndoes not include the raw data---individual participants' responses or\nscores---researchers should save their raw data and make them available\nto other researchers who request them. Some journals now make the raw\ndata available online.\n\nAlthough there are no standard subsections, it is still important for\nthe results section to be logically organized. Typically it begins with\ncertain preliminary issues. One is whether any participants or responses\nwere excluded from the analyses and why. The rationale for excluding\ndata should be described clearly so that other researchers can decide\nwhether it is appropriate. A second preliminary issue is how multiple\nresponses were combined to produce the primary variables in the\nanalyses. For example, if participants rated the attractiveness of 20\nstimulus people, you might have to explain that you began by computing\nthe mean attractiveness rating for each participant. Or if they recalled\nas many items as they could from study list of 20 words, did you count\nthe number correctly recalled, compute the percentage correctly\nrecalled, or perhaps compute the number correct minus the number\nincorrect? A third preliminary issue is the reliability of the measures.\nThis is where you would present test-retest correlations, Cronbach's α,\nor other statistics to show that the measures are consistent across time\nand across items. A final preliminary issue is whether the manipulation\nwas successful. This is where you would report the results of any\nmanipulation checks.\n\nThe results section should then tackle the primary research questions,\none at a time. Again, there should be a clear organization. One approach\nwould be to answer the most general questions and then proceed to answer\nmore specific ones. Another would be to answer the main question first\nand then to answer secondary ones. Regardless, @bem2003writing suggests\nthe following basic structure for discussing each new result:\n\n1.  Remind the reader of the research question.\n2.  Give the answer to the research question in words.\n3.  Present the relevant statistics.\n4.  Qualify the answer if necessary.\n5.  Summarize the result.\n\nNotice that only Step 3 necessarily involves numbers. The rest of the\nsteps involve presenting the research question and the answer to it in\nwords. In fact, the basic results should be clear even to a reader who\nskips over the numbers.\n\n#### Discussion {.unnumbered}\n\nThe [discussion] is the last major section of the research report.\nDiscussions usually consist of some combination of the following\nelements:\n\n-   Summary of the research\n-   Theoretical implications\n-   Practical implications\n-   Limitations\n-   Suggestions for future research\n\nThe discussion typically begins with a summary of the study that\nprovides a clear answer to the research question. In a short report with\na single study, this might require no more than a sentence. In a longer\nreport with multiple studies, it might require a paragraph or even two.\nThe summary is often followed by a discussion of the theoretical\nimplications of the research. Do the results provide support for any\nexisting theories? If not, how *can* they be explained? Although you do\nnot have to provide a definitive explanation or detailed theory for your\nresults, you at least need to outline one or more possible explanations.\nIn applied research---and often in basic research---there is also some\ndiscussion of the practical implications of the research. How can the\nresults be used, and by whom, to accomplish some real-world goal?\n\nThe theoretical and practical implications are often followed by a\ndiscussion of the study's limitations. Perhaps there are problems with\nits internal or external validity. Perhaps the manipulation was not very\neffective or the measures not very reliable. Perhaps there is some\nevidence that participants did not fully understand their task or that\nthey were suspicious of the intent of the researchers. Now is the time\nto discuss these issues and how they might have affected the results.\nBut do not overdo it. All studies have limitations, and most readers\nwill understand that a different sample or different measures might have\nproduced different results. Unless there is good reason to think they\n*would* have, however, there is no reason to mention these routine\nissues. Instead, pick two or three limitations that seem like they could\nhave influenced the results, explain how they could have influenced the\nresults, and suggest ways to deal with them.\n\nMost discussions end with some suggestions for future research. If the\nstudy did not satisfactorily answer the original research question, what\nwill it take to do so? What *new* research questions has the study\nraised? This part of the discussion, however, is not just a list of new\nquestions. It is a discussion of two or three of the most important\nunresolved issues. This means identifying and clarifying each question,\nsuggesting some alternative answers, and even suggesting ways they could\nbe studied.\n\nFinally, some researchers are quite good at ending their articles with a\nsweeping or thought-provoking conclusion. @darley1968bystander for\nexample, ended their article on the bystander effect by discussing the\nidea that whether people help others may depend more on the situation\nthan on their personalities. Their final sentence is, \"If people\nunderstand the situational forces that can make them hesitate to\nintervene, they may better overcome them\" (p. 383). However, this kind\nof ending can be difficult to pull off. It can sound overreaching or\njust banal and end up detracting from the overall impact of the article.\nIt is often better simply to end when you have made your final point\n(although you should avoid ending on a limitation).\n\n#### References {.unnumbered}\n\nThe references section begins on a new page with the heading\n\"References\" centered and bolded at the top of the page. All references\ncited in the text are then listed in the format presented earlier. They\nare listed alphabetically by the last name of the first author. If two\nsources have the same first author, they are listed alphabetically by\nthe last name of the second author. If all the authors are the same,\nthen they are listed chronologically by the year of publication.\nEverything in the reference list is double-spaced both within and\nbetween references.\n\n#### Appendixes, Tables, and Figures {.unnumbered}\n\nAppendixes, tables, and figures come after the references. An [appendix]\nis appropriate for supplemental material that would interrupt the flow\nof the research report if it were presented within any of the major\nsections. An appendix could be used to present lists of stimulus words,\nquestionnaire items, detailed descriptions of special equipment or\nunusual statistical analyses, or references to the studies that are\nincluded in a meta-analysis. Each appendix begins on a new page. If\nthere is only one, the heading is \"Appendix,\" centered at the top of the\npage. If there is more than one, the headings are \"Appendix A,\"\n\"Appendix B,\" and so on, and they appear in the order they were first\nmentioned in the text of the report.\n\nWhat about tables and figures? Tables and figures are both used to\npresent results. Figures can also be used to illustrate theories (e.g.,\nin the form of a flowchart), display stimuli, outline procedures, and\npresent many other kinds of information. The traditional way to present\ntables and figures is at the end of the paper, after the references and\nany appendixes, with each table and figure appearing on its own page.\nThis is still an acceptable way to present tables and figures. However,\nstarting in the seventh edition of the *Publication Manual*, APA style\nnow permits embedding tables and figures in text near the first time\nthey are mentioned. Tables are numbered in the order that they are first\nmentioned in the text (\"Table 1,\" \"Table 2,\" and so on). Figures are\nnumbered the same way (\"Figure 1,\" \"Figure 2,\" and so on). A brief\nexplanatory title, with the important words capitalized, appears above\neach table and figure. More details on preparing APA-style tables and\nfigures are presented later in the book.\n\n::: fyi\n##### Professional or Student Paper? {.unnumbered}\n\nAPA formatting guidelines have traditionally been tailored for\n**professional papers** that resesarchers submit for publication.\nStarting in the seventh edition of the *Publication Manual* released in\n2020, the APA now offers slightly different formatting guidelines for\n**student papers** that aren't intended for publication. The main\ndifferences are as follows:\n\n-   **Title page:** Professional papers list the title, authors, and\n    affiliations. Student papers add course information such as class\n    name, instructor name, and due date.\n-   **Author note:** Not required for student papers.\n-   **Running head:** Not required for student papers unless required by\n    the instructor. Page numbers are required for student papers.\n-   **Abstract:** Not required for student papers unless required by the\n    instructor.\n-   **Keywords:** Not required for student papers unless required by the\n    instructor.\n\nMany instructors still prefer the professional format; consult your\nassignment guidelines. You can view [sample professonal and student\npapers on the APA\nwebsite](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/paper-format/sample-papers).\n:::\n\n#### Sample APA-Style Research Report {.unnumbered}\n\nFigure \\@ref(fig:sample1), Figure \\@ref(fig:sample2), Figure\n\\@ref(fig:sample3), and Figure \\@ref(fig:sample4) show some sample pages\nfrom an APA-style empirical research report. The main purpose of these\nfigures is to illustrate the basic organization and formatting of an\nAPA-style empirical research report, although many high-level and\nlow-level style conventions can be seen here too.\n\n> *Note: The pages below are adapted from the preprint of a manuscript\n> published in* Contemporary Educatianal Psychology\n> [@pilegard2016improving]*.

The main ones are the abstract, introduction, method,\n    results, discussion, and references.\n-   The introduction consists of an opening that presents the research\n    question, a literature review that describes previous research on\n    the topic, and a closing that restates the research question and\n    comments on the method. The literature review constitutes an\n    argument for why the current study is worth doing.\n-   The method section describes the method in enough detail that\n    another researcher could replicate the study. At a minimum, it\n    consists of a participants subsection and a design and procedure\n    subsection.\n-   The results section describes the results in an organized fashion.\n    Each primary result is presented in terms of statistical results but\n    also explained in words.\n-   The discussion typically summarizes the study, discusses theoretical\n    and practical implications and limitations of the study, and offers\n    suggestions for further research.\n:::\n\n::: exercises\n##### EXERCISES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Practice: Look through an issue of a general interest professional\n    journal (e.g., *Psychological Science*). Read the opening of the\n    first five articles and rate the effectiveness of each one from 1\n    (*very ineffective*) to 5 (*very effective*). Write a sentence or\n    two explaining each rating.\n2.  Practice: Find a recent article in a professional journal and\n    identify where the opening, literature review, and closing of the\n    introduction begin and end.\n3.  Practice: Find a recent article in a professional journal and\n    highlight in a different color each of the following elements in the\n    discussion: summary, theoretical implications, practical\n    implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research.\n:::\n\n## Other Presentation Formats\n\n::: learningobjectives\n##### LEARNING OBJECTIVES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  List several ways that researchers in psychology can present their\n    research and the situations in which they might use them.\n2.  Describe how final manuscripts differ from copy manuscripts in\n    American Psychological Association (APA) style.\n3.  Describe the purpose of talks and posters at professional\n    conferences.\n4.  Prepare a short conference-style talk and simple poster\n    presentation.\n:::\n\nWriting an empirical research report in American Psychological\nAssociation (APA) style is only one way to present new research in\npsychology. In this section, we look at several other important ways.\n\n### Other Types of Manuscripts {.unnumbered}\n\nThe previous section focused on writing empirical research reports to be\nsubmitted for publication in a professional journal. However, there are\nother kinds of manuscripts that are written in APA style, many of which\nwill not be submitted for publication elsewhere. Here we look at a few\nof them.\n\n#### Review and Theoretical Articles {.unnumbered}\n\nRecall that [review articles](#review-article) summarize research on a\nparticular topic without presenting new empirical results. When these\narticles present a new theory, they are often called [theoretical\narticles](#theoretical-article). Review and theoretical articles are\nstructured much like empirical research reports, with a title page, an\nabstract, references, appendixes, tables, and figures, and they are\nwritten in the same high-level and low-level style. Because they do not\nreport the results of new empirical research, however, there is no\nmethod or results section. Of course, the body of the manuscript should\nstill have a logical organization and include an opening that identifies\nthe topic and explains its importance, a literature review that\norganizes previous research (identifying important relationships among\nconcepts or gaps in the literature), and a closing or conclusion that\nsummarizes the main conclusions and suggests directions for further\nresearch or discusses theoretical and practical implications. In a\ntheoretical article, of course, much of the body of the manuscript is\ndevoted to presenting the new theory. Theoretical and review articles\nare usually divided into sections, each with a heading that is\nappropriate to that section. The sections and headings can vary\nconsiderably from article to article (unlike in an empirical research\nreport). But whatever they are, they should help organize the manuscript\nand make the argument clear.\n\n#### Final Manuscripts {.unnumbered}\n\nWe have focused on the formatting of manuscripts that will be submitted\nto a professional journal for publication. These are referred to as\n[copy manuscripts](#copy-manuscript). Many features of a copy\nmanuscript---consistent double-spacing, the running head, and the\nplacement of tables and figures at the end---are intended to make it\neasier to edit and typeset on its way to publication. The published\njournal article looks quite different from the copy manuscript. For\nexample, the title and author information, the abstract, and the\nbeginning of the introduction generally appear on the same page rather\nthan on separate pages. In contrast, other types of manuscripts are\nprepared by the author in their final form with no intention of\nsubmitting them for publication elsewhere. These are called [final\nmanuscripts](#final-manuscript) and include dissertations, theses, and\nother student papers.\n\nFinal manuscripts can differ from copy manuscripts in a number of ways\nthat make them easier to read. This can include variations in line\nspacing that improve readability---such as using single spacing for\ntable titles and figure captions or triple spacing between major\nsections or around tables and figures. Dissertations and theses can\ndiffer from copy manuscripts in additional ways. They may have a longer\nabstract, a special acknowledgments page, a table of contents, and so\non. For student papers, it is important to check with the course\ninstructor about formatting specifics. In a research methods course,\npapers are often required to be written as though they were copy\nmanuscripts being submitted for publication (see box [Professional or\nStudent Paper?]).\n\n### Conference Presentations {.unnumbered}\n\nOne of the ways that researchers in psychology share their research with\neach other is by presenting it at [professional\nconferences](#professional-conference). (Although some professional\nconferences in psychology are devoted mainly to issues of clinical\npractice, we are concerned here with those that focus on research.)\nProfessional conferences can range from small-scale events involving a\ndozen researchers who get together for an afternoon to large-scale\nevents involving thousands of researchers who meet for several days.\nAlthough researchers attending a professional conference are likely to\ndiscuss their work with each other informally, there are two more formal\ntypes of presentation: oral presentations (\"talks\") and posters.\nPresenting a talk or poster at a conference usually requires submitting\nan abstract of the research to the conference organizers in advance and\nhaving it accepted for presentation---although the peer review process\nis typically not as rigorous as it is for manuscripts submitted to a\nprofessional journal.\n\n::: fyi\n##### Professional Conferences {.unnumbered}\n\nFollowing are links to the websites for several large national\nconferences in the United States and also for several conferences that\nfeature the work of undergraduate students.\n\n*Large National Conferences*\n\n[American Psychological Association\nConvention](https://convention.apa.org/)\n\n[Association for Psychological Science\nConference](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/conventions)\n\n[Society for Personality and Social Psychology\nConference](https://spsp.org/events/annual-convention)\n\n[Psychonomic Society Annual\nMeeting](https://www.psychonomic.org/page/meetings)\n\n*Undergraduate Conferences*\n\n[Carolinas Psychology\nConference](https://education.campbell.edu/psychology/carolinas-psychology-conference/)\n\n[Illowa Undergraduate Psychology\nConference](http://research.monm.edu/illowa/)\n\n[L.

Talks usually last from 10 to 20 minutes, with the\nlast few minutes reserved for questions from the audience. At larger\nconferences, talks are typically grouped into sessions lasting an hour\nor two in which all the talks are on the same general topic.\n\nIn preparing a talk, presenters should keep several general principles\nin mind. The first is that the number of slides should be no more than\nabout one per minute of the talk. The second is that a talk is generally\nstructured like an APA-style research report. There is a slide with the\ntitle and authors, a few slides to help provide the background, a few\nmore to help describe the method, a few for the results, and a few for\nthe conclusions. The third is that the presenter speak to the audience\nmembers in a conversational tone that is less formal than APA-style\nwriting but more formal than a conversation with a friend. The slides\nshould not be the focus of the presentation; they should act as visual\naids. As such, they should present main points in bulleted lists or\nsimple tables and figures.\n\n#### Posters {.unnumbered}\n\nAnother way to present research at a conference is in the form of a\n[poster]. A poster is typically presented during a one- to two-hour\n[poster session] that takes place in a large room at the conference\nsite. In a traditional poster session, presenters set up their posters\non bulletin boards arranged around the room and stand near them. Other\nresearchers then circulate through the room, read the posters, and talk\nto the presenters. In essence, poster sessions are a grown-up version of\nthe school science fair. But there is nothing childish about them.\nPosters are used by professional researchers in all scientific\ndisciplines and they are becoming increasingly common. At a recent\nAmerican Psychological Society Conference, nearly 2,000 posters were\npresented across 16 separate poster sessions. Among the reasons posters\nare so popular is that they encourage meaningful interaction among\nresearchers.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![New research is often presented in the form of posters at professional conferences. *Photo by Peter Macdonald on Flickr.*](images/ch11/poster.jpeg){fig-align='center' width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAlthough a poster can consist of several sheets of paper that are\nattached separately to the bulletin board, it is now more common for\nthem to consist of a single large sheet of paper. Either way, the\ninformation is organized into distinct sections, including a title,\nauthor names and affiliations, an introduction, a method section, a\nresults section, a discussion or conclusions section, references, and\nacknowledgments. Although posters can include an abstract, this may not\nbe necessary because the poster itself is already a brief summary of the\nresearch. Figure \\@ref(fig:posterorg) shows two different ways that the\ninformation on a poster might be organized.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Two possible ways to organize the information on a poster.](images/ch11/posterorg.png){fig-align='center' width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nGiven the conditions under which posters are often presented---for\nexample, in crowded ballrooms where people are also eating, drinking,\nand socializing---they should be constructed so that they present the\nmain ideas behind the research in as simple and clear a way as possible.\nThe font sizes on a poster should be large---perhaps 72 points for the\ntitle and authors' names and 28 points for the main text. The\ninformation should be organized into sections with clear headings, and\ntext should be blocked into sentences or bulleted points rather than\nparagraphs. It is also better for it to be organized in columns and flow\nfrom top to bottom rather than to be organized in rows that flow across\nthe poster. This makes it easier for multiple people to read at the same\ntime without bumping into each other. Posters often include elements\nthat add visual interest. Figures can be more colorful than those in an\nAPA-style manuscript. Posters can also include copies of visual stimuli,\nphotographs of the apparatus, or a simulation of participants being\ntested. They can also include purely decorative elements, although it is\nbest not to overdo these.\n\nAgain, a primary reason that posters are such a popular way to present\nresearch is that they facilitate interaction among researchers. Many\npresenters immediately offer to describe their research to visitors and\nuse the poster as a visual aid. At the very least, it is important for\npresenters to stand by their posters, greet visitors, offer to answer\nquestions, and be prepared for questions and even the occasional\ncritical comment. It is generally a good idea to have a more detailed\nwrite-up of the research available for visitors who want more\ninformation, to offer to send them a detailed write-up, or to provide\ncontact information so that they can request more information later.\n\nFor more information on preparing and presenting both talks and posters,\nsee the website of Psi Chi, the International Honor Society in\nPsychology: http://www.psichi.org/conventions/tips.aspx.\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   Research in psychology can be presented in several different\n    formats. In addition to APA-style empirical research reports, there\n    are theoretical and review articles; final manuscripts, including\n    dissertations, theses, and student papers; and talks and posters at\n    professional conferences.\n-   Talks and posters at professional conferences follow some APA style\n    guidelines but are considerably less detailed than APA-style\n    research reports. Their function is to present new research to\n    interested researchers and facilitate further interaction among\n    researchers.\n:::\n\n::: exercises\n##### EXERCISE {.unnumbered}\n\n1.
