Define the concept of a variable, distinguish quantitative from\n    categorical variables, and give examples of variables that might be\n    of interest to psychologists.\n2.  Explain the difference between a population and a sample.\n3.  Describe two basic forms of statistical relationship and give\n    examples of each.\n4.  Interpret basic statistics and graphs used to describe statistical\n    relationships.\n5.  Explain why correlation does not imply causation.\n:::\n\n### Variables {.unnumbered}\n\nResearch questions in psychology are about [variables](#variable). A\nvariable is a quantity or quality that varies across people or\nsituations. For example, the height of the students in a psychology\nclass is a variable because it varies from student to student. The sex\nof the students is also a variable as long as there are both male and\nfemale students in the class. A [quantitative variable] is a quantity,\nsuch as height, that is typically measured by assigning a number to each\nindividual. Other examples of quantitative variables include people's\nlevel of talkativeness, how depressed they are, and the number of\nsiblings they have. A [categorical variable] is a quality, such as sex,\nand is typically measured by assigning a category label to each\nindividual. Other examples include people's nationality, their\noccupation, and whether they are receiving psychotherapy.\n\n### Sampling and Measurement {.unnumbered}\n\nResearchers in psychology are usually interested in drawing conclusions\nabout some very large group of people. This is called the [population].\nIt could be American teenagers, children with autism, professional\nathletes, or even just human beings---depending on the interests and\ngoals of the researcher. But they usually study only a small subset or\n[sample] of the population. For example, a researcher might measure the\ntalkativeness of a few hundred college students with the intention of\ndrawing conclusions about the talkativeness of men and women in general.\nIt is important, therefore, for researchers to use a representative\nsample---one that is similar to the population in important respects.\n\nOne method of obtaining a sample is simple random sampling, in which\nevery member of the population has an equal chance of being selected for\nthe sample. For example, a pollster could start with a list of all the\nregistered voters in a city (the population), randomly select 100 of\nthem from the list (the sample), and ask those 100 whom they intended to\nvote for. Unfortunately, random sampling is difficult or impossible in\nmost psychological research because the populations are less clearly\ndefined than the registered voters in a city. How could a researcher\ngive all American teenagers or all children with autism an equal chance\nof being selected for a sample? The most common alternative to random\nsampling is convenience sampling, in which the sample consists of\nindividuals who happen to be nearby and willing to participate (such as\nintroductory psychology students). The obvious problem with convenience\nsampling is that the sample might not be representative of the\npopulation.\n\nOnce the sample is selected, researchers need to measure the variables\nthey are interested in. This requires an [operational definition]---a\ndefinition of the variable in terms of precisely how it is to be\nmeasured. Most variables can be operationally defined in many different\nways. For example, depression can be operationally defined as people's\nscores on a paper-and-pencil depression scale, the number of depressive\nsymptoms they are experiencing, or whether they have been diagnosed with\nmajor depressive disorder. When a variable has been measured for a\nparticular individual, the result is called a score, and a set of scores\nis called data. Note that data is plural---the singular datum is rarely\nused---so it is grammatically correct to say, \"Those are interesting\ndata\" (and incorrect to say, \"That is interesting data\").\n\n### Statistical Relationships Between Variables {.unnumbered}\n\nSome research questions in psychology are about one variable. How\naccurate are children's memories for being touched? How talkative are\nAmerican college students? How common is it for people to be diagnosed\nwith major depressive disorder? Answering such questions requires\noperationally defining the variable, measuring it for a sample,\nanalyzing the results, and drawing conclusions about the population. For\na quantitative variable, this would typically involve computing the mean\nand standard deviation of the scores. For a categorical variable, it\nwould typically involve computing the percentage of scores at each level\nof the variable.\n\nHowever, research questions in psychology are more likely to be about\nstatistical relationships between variables. There is a [statistical\nrelationship] between two variables when the average score on one\ndiffers systematically across the levels of the other. Studying\nstatistical relationships is important because instead of telling us\nabout behaviors and psychological characteristics in isolation, it tells\nus about the causes, consequences, development, and organization of\nthose behaviors and characteristics.\n\nThere are two basic forms of statistical relationship: differences\nbetween groups and correlations between quantitative variables. Although\nboth are consistent with the general definition of a statistical\nrelationship---the average score on one variable differs across levels\nof the other---they are usually described and analyzed somewhat\ndifferently. For this reason it is important to distinguish them\nclearly.\n\n#### Differences Between Groups {.unnumbered}\n\nOne basic form of statistical relationship is a difference between the\nmean scores of two groups on some variable of interest. A wide variety\nof research questions in psychology take this form. Are women more\ntalkative than men? Do children using human figure drawings recall more\ntouch information than children not using human figure drawings? Do\npeople talking on a cell phone have poorer driving abilities than people\nnot talking on a cell phone? Do people receiving Psychotherapy A tend to\nhave fewer depressive symptoms than people receiving Psychotherapy B?\nLater we will also see that such relationships can involve more than two\ngroups and that the groups can consist of the very same individuals\ntested at different times or under different conditions. For now,\nhowever, it is easiest to think in terms of two distinct groups.\n\nDifferences between groups are usually described by giving the mean\nscore and standard deviation for each group. This information can also\nbe presented in a bar graph like that in Figure \\@ref(fig:bargraph),\nwhere the heights of the bars represent the group means.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bar graph showing the very small difference in the mean number of words spoken per day by women and men in a large sample. Based on data from @mehl2007women](02-getting-started_files/figure-pdf/bargraph-1.pdf){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Correlations Between Quantitative Variables {.unnumbered}\n\nA second basic form of statistical relationship is a correlation between\ntwo quantitative variables, where the average score on one variable\ndiffers systematically across the levels of the other. Again, a wide\nvariety of research questions in psychology take this form. Is being a\nhappier person associated with being more talkative? Do children's\nmemories for touch information improve as they get older? Does the\neffectiveness of psychotherapy depend on how much the patient likes the\ntherapist?\n\nCorrelations between quantitative variables are often presented using\n[scatterplots](#scatterplot). Figure \\@ref(fig:scatter) shows some\nhypothetical data on the relationship between the amount of stress\npeople are under and the number of physical symptoms they have. Each\npoint in the scatterplot represents one person's score on both\nvariables. For example, the circled point in Figure \\@ref(fig:scatter)\nrepresents a person whose stress score was 10 and who had three physical\nsymptoms. Taking all the points into account, one can see that people\nunder more stress tend to have more physical symptoms. This is a good\nexample of a positive relationship, in which higher scores on one\nvariable tend to be associated with higher scores on the other. A\nnegative relationship is one in which higher scores on one variable tend\nto be associated with lower scores on the other. There is a negative\nrelationship between stress and immune system functioning, for example,\nbecause higher stress is associated with lower immune system\nfunctioning.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot showing a hypothetical positive relationship between stress and number of physical symptoms. The point highlighted in the blue box represents a person whose stress score was 10 and who had three physical symptoms. Pearson’s *r* for these data is +.51.](02-getting-started_files/figure-pdf/scatter-1.pdf){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe strength of a correlation between quantitative variables is\ntypically measured using a statistic called [Pearson's\n*r*](#pearsons-r). As Figure \\@ref(fig:pearson) shows, Pearson's *r*\nranges from −1.00 (the strongest possible negative relationship) to\n+1.00 (the strongest possible positive relationship). A value of 0 means\nthere is no relationship between the two variables. When Pearson's *r*\nis 0, the points on a scatterplot form a shapeless \"cloud.\" As its value\nmoves toward −1.00 or +1.00, the points come closer and closer to\nfalling on a single straight line.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Range of Pearson’s *r*, from −1.00 (strongest possible negative relationship), through 0 (no relationship), to +1.00 (strongest possible positive relationship)](images/getting-started/pearson.png){fig-align='center' width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nPearson's *r* is a good measure only for linear relationships, in which\nthe points are best approximated by a straight line. It is not a good\nmeasure for nonlinear relationships, in which the points are better\napproximated by a curved line. Figure \\@ref(fig:nonlinear), for example,\nshows a hypothetical relationship between the amount of sleep people get\nper night and their level of depression. In this example, the line that\nbest approximates the points is a U-shaped curve, because people who get\nabout eight hours of sleep tend to be the least depressed. Those who get\ntoo little sleep and those who get too much sleep tend to be more\ndepressed. Nonlinear relationships are fairly common in psychology, but\nmeasuring their strength is beyond the scope of this book.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Hypothetical nonlinear relationship between sleep and depression.](02-getting-started_files/figure-pdf/nonlinear-1.pdf){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Correlation Does Not Imply Causation {.unnumbered}\n\nResearchers are often interested in a statistical relationship between\ntwo variables because they think that one of the variables causes the\nother. That is, the statistical relationship reflects a causal\nrelationship. In these situations, the variable that is thought to be\nthe cause is called the [independent variable] (often referred to as *X*\nfor short), and the variable that is thought to be the effect is called\nthe [dependent variable] (often referred to as *Y*). For example, the\nstatistical relationship between whether or not a depressed person\nreceives psychotherapy and the number of depressive symptoms he or she\nhas reflects the fact that the psychotherapy (the independent variable)\n*causes* the reduction in symptoms (the dependent variable).\nUnderstanding causal relationships is important in part because it\nallows us to change people's behavior in predictable ways. If we know\nthat psychotherapy causes a reduction in depressive symptoms---and we\nwant people to have fewer depressive symptoms---then we can use\npsychotherapy to achieve this goal.\n\nBut not all statistical relationships reflect causal relationships. This\nis what psychologists mean when they say, \"Correlation does not imply\ncausation.\" An obvious example comes from a study in Taiwan showing a\npositive relationship between the number of electrical appliances that\npeople use and the extent to which they use birth control\n[@stanovich2013think]. It seems clear, however, that this does not mean\nthat owning electrical appliances causes people to use birth control,\nand it would not make sense to try to increase the use of birth control\nby giving people toasters and hair dryers.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A Public Service Announcement.](images/getting-started/correlationdoesnotimplycausation.png){fig-align='center' width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThere are two reasons that correlation does not imply causation. The\nfirst is called the [directionality problem]. Two variables, *X* and\n*Y*, can be statistically related because *X* causes *Y* or because *Y*\ncauses *X.* Consider, for example, a study showing that whether or not\npeople exercise is statistically related to how happy they are---such\nthat people who exercise are happier on average than people who do not.\nThis statistical relationship is consistent with the idea that\nexercising causes happiness, but it is also consistent with the idea\nthat happiness causes exercise. Perhaps being happy gives people more\nenergy or leads them to seek opportunities to socialize with others by\ngoing to the gym. The second reason that correlation does not imply\ncausation is called the [third-variable problem]. Two variables, *X* and\n*Y*, can be statistically related not because *X* causes *Y*, or because\n*Y* causes *X*, but because some third variable, *Z*, causes both *X*\nand *Y.* For example, the fact that people with more electrical\nappliances are more likely to use birth control probably reflects the\nfact that having more education or income causes people to own more\nappliances and causes them to use birth control. Similarly, the\nstatistical relationship between exercise and happiness could mean that\nsome third variable, such as physical health, causes both of the others.\nBeing physically healthy could cause people to exercise and cause them\nto be happier.\n\n::: fyi\n##### \"Lots of Candy Could Lead to Violence\" {.unnumbered}\n\nAlthough researchers in psychology know that correlation does not imply\ncausation, many journalists do not. One website about correlation and\ncausation,\nhttp://jonathan.mueller.faculty.noctrl.edu/100/correlation_or_causation.htm,\nlinks to dozens of media reports about real biomedical and psychological\nresearch. Many of the headlines suggest that a causal relationship has\nbeen demonstrated, when a careful reading of the articles shows that it\nhas not because of the directionality and third-variable problems.\n\nOne article is about a study showing that children who ate candy every\nday were more likely than other children to be arrested for a violent\noffense later in life. But could candy really \"lead to\" violence, as the\nheadline suggests? What alternative explanations can you think of for\nthis statistical relationship? How could the headline be rewritten so\nthat it is not misleading?\n:::\n\nAs we will see later in the book, there are various ways that\nresearchers address the directionality and third-variable problems. The\nmost effective, however, is to conduct an [experiment]. An experiment is\na study in which the researcher manipulates the independent variable.\nFor example, instead of simply measuring how much people exercise, a\nresearcher could bring people into a laboratory and randomly assign half\nof them to run on a treadmill for 15 minutes and the rest to sit on a\ncouch for 15 minutes. Although this seems like a minor addition to the\nresearch design, it is extremely important. Now if the exercisers end up\nin more positive moods than those who did not exercise, it cannot be\nbecause their moods affected how much they exercised (because it was the\nresearcher who determined how much they exercised). Likewise, it cannot\nbe because some third variable (e.g., physical health) affected both how\nmuch they exercised and what mood they were in (because, again, it was\nthe researcher who determined how much they exercised). Thus experiments\neliminate the directionality and third-variable problems and allow\nresearchers to draw firm conclusions about causal relationships. We will\nhave much more to say about experimental and nonexperimental research\nlater in the book.\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   Research questions in psychology are about variables and\n    relationships between variables.\n-   Two basic forms of statistical relationship are differences between\n    group means and correlations between quantitative variables, each of\n    which can be described using a few simple statistical techniques.\n-   Correlation does not imply causation.

List several ways in which qualitative research differs from\n    quantitative research in psychology.\n2.  Describe the strengths and weaknesses of qualitative research in\n    psychology compared with quantitative research.\n3.  Give examples of qualitative research in psychology.\n:::\n\n### What Is Qualitative Research? {.unnumbered}\n\nThis book is primarily about [quantitative research]. Quantitative\nresearchers typically start with a focused research question or\nhypothesis, collect a small amount of data from each of a large number\nof individuals, describe the resulting data using statistical\ntechniques, and draw general conclusions about some large population.\nAlthough this is by far the most common approach to conducting empirical\nresearch in psychology, there is an important alternative called\nqualitative research. Qualitative research originated in the disciplines\nof anthropology and sociology but is now used to study many\npsychological topics as well. Qualitative researchers generally begin\nwith a less focused research question, collect large amounts of\nrelatively \"unfiltered\" data from a relatively small number of\nindividuals, and describe their data using nonstatistical techniques.\nThey are usually less concerned with drawing general conclusions about\nhuman behavior than with understanding in detail the experience of their\nresearch participants.\n\nConsider, for example, a study by researcher Per Lindqvist and his\ncolleagues, who wanted to learn how the families of teenage suicide\nvictims cope with their loss [@lindqvist2008aftermath]. They did not\nhave a specific research question or hypothesis, such as, What\npercentage of family members join suicide support groups? Instead, they\nwanted to understand the variety of reactions that families had, with a\nfocus on what it is like from *their* perspectives. To do this, they\ninterviewed the families of 10 teenage suicide victims in their homes in\nrural Sweden. The interviews were relatively unstructured, beginning\nwith a general request for the families to talk about the victim and\nending with an invitation to talk about anything else that they wanted\nto tell the interviewer. One of the most important themes that emerged\nfrom these interviews was that even as life returned to \"normal,\" the\nfamilies continued to struggle with the question of why their loved one\ncommitted suicide. This struggle appeared to be especially difficult for\nfamilies in which the suicide was most unexpected.\n\n### The Purpose of Qualitative Research {.unnumbered}\n\nAgain, this book is primarily about quantitative research in psychology.\nThe strength of quantitative research is its ability to provide precise\nanswers to specific research questions and to draw general conclusions\nabout human behavior. This is how we know that people have a strong\ntendency to obey authority figures, for example, or that female college\nstudents are not substantially more talkative than male college\nstudents. But while quantitative research is good at providing precise\nanswers to specific research questions, it is not nearly as good at\n*generating* novel and interesting research questions. Likewise, while\nquantitative research is good at drawing general conclusions about human\nbehavior, it is not nearly as good at providing detailed descriptions of\nthe behavior of particular groups in particular situations. And it is\nnot very good at all at communicating what it is actually like to be a\nmember of a particular group in a particular situation.\n\nBut the relative weaknesses of quantitative research are the relative\nstrengths of qualitative research. Qualitative research can help\nresearchers to generate new and interesting research questions and\nhypotheses. The research of Lindqvist and colleagues, for example,\nsuggests that there may be a general relationship between how unexpected\na suicide is and how consumed the family is with trying to understand\nwhy the teen committed suicide. This relationship can now be explored\nusing quantitative research. But it is unclear whether this question\nwould have arisen at all without the researchers sitting down with the\nfamilies and listening to what they themselves wanted to say about their\nexperience. Qualitative research can also provide rich and detailed\ndescriptions of human behavior in the real-world contexts in which it\noccurs. Among qualitative researchers, this is often referred to as\n\"thick description\" [@geertz1973interpretation]. Similarly, qualitative\nresearch can convey a sense of what it is actually like to be a member\nof a particular group or in a particular situation---what qualitative\nresearchers often refer to as the \"lived experience\" of the research\nparticipants. Lindqvist and colleagues, for example, describe how all\nthe families spontaneously offered to show the interviewer the victim's\nbedroom or the place where the suicide occurred---revealing the\nimportance of these physical locations to the families. It seems\nunlikely that a quantitative study would have discovered this.\n\n### Data Collection and Analysis in Qualitative Research {.unnumbered}\n\nAs with correlational research, data collection approaches in\nqualitative research are quite varied and can involve naturalistic\nobservation, archival data, artwork, and many other things. But one of\nthe most common approaches, especially for psychological research, is to\nconduct [interviews]. Interviews in qualitative research tend to be\nunstructured---consisting of a small number of general questions or\nprompts that allow participants to talk about what is of interest to\nthem. The researcher can follow up by asking more detailed questions\nabout the topics that do come up. Such interviews can be lengthy and\ndetailed, but they are usually conducted with a relatively small sample.\nThis was essentially the approach used by Lindqvist and colleagues in\ntheir research on the families of suicide survivors. Small groups of\npeople who participate together in interviews focused on a particular\ntopic or issue are often referred to as [focus groups]. The interaction\namong participants in a focus group can sometimes bring out more\ninformation than can be learned in a one-on-one interview. The use of\nfocus groups has become a standard technique in business and industry\namong those who want to understand consumer tastes and preferences. The\ncontent of all focus group interviews is usually recorded and\ntranscribed to facilitate later analyses.\n\nAnother approach to data collection in qualitative research is\nparticipant observation. In [participant observation], researchers\nbecome active participants in the group or situation they are studying.\nThe data they collect can include interviews (usually unstructured),\ntheir own notes based on their observations and interactions, documents,\nphotographs, and other artifacts. The basic rationale for participant\nobservation is that there may be important information that is only\naccessible to, or can be interpreted only by, someone who is an active\nparticipant in the group or situation. An example of participant\nobservation comes from a study by sociologist Amy Wilkins (published in\n*Social Psychology Quarterly*) on a college-based religious organization\nthat emphasized how happy its members were [@wilkins2008happier].\nWilkins spent 12 months attending and participating in the group's\nmeetings and social events, and she interviewed several group members.\nIn her study, Wilkins identified several ways in which the group\n\"enforced\" happiness---for example, by continually talking about\nhappiness, discouraging the expression of negative emotions, and using\nhappiness as a way to distinguish themselves from other groups.\n\n#### Data Analysis in Qualitative Research {.unnumbered}\n\nAlthough quantitative and qualitative research generally differ along\nseveral important dimensions (e.g., the specificity of the research\nquestion, the type of data collected), it is the method of data\n*analysis* that distinguishes them more clearly than anything else. To\nillustrate this idea, imagine a team of researchers that conducts a\nseries of unstructured interviews with recovering alcoholics to learn\nabout the role of their religious faith in their recovery. Although this\nsounds like qualitative research, imagine further that once they collect\nthe data, they code the data in terms of how often each participant\nmentions God (or a \"higher power\"), and they then use descriptive and\ninferential statistics to find out whether those who mention God more\noften are more successful in abstaining from alcohol. Now it sounds like\nquantitative research. In other words, the quantitative-qualitative\ndistinction depends more on what researchers *do* with the data they\nhave collected than with why or how they collected the data.\n\nBut what does qualitative data analysis look like? Just as there are\nmany ways to collect data in qualitative research, there are many ways\nto analyze data. Here we focus on one general approach called [grounded\ntheory] [@glaser2017discovery]. This approach was developed within the\nfield of sociology in the 1960s and has gradually gained popularity in\npsychology. Remember that in quantitative research, it is typical for\nthe researcher to start with a theory, derive a hypothesis from that\ntheory, and then collect data to test that specific hypothesis. In\nqualitative research using grounded theory, researchers start with the\ndata and develop a theory or an interpretation that is \"grounded in\"\nthose data. They do this in stages. First, they identify ideas that are\nrepeated throughout the data. Then they organize these ideas into a\nsmaller number of broader themes. Finally, they write a [theoretical\nnarrative]---an interpretation---of the data in terms of the themes that\nthey have identified. This theoretical narrative focuses on the\nsubjective experience of the participants and is usually supported by\nmany direct quotations from the participants themselves.\n\nAs an example, consider a study by researchers Laura Abrams and Laura\nCurran, who used the grounded theory approach to study the experience of\npostpartum depression symptoms among low-income mothers\n[@abrams2009and]. Their data were the result of unstructured interviews\nwith 19 participants. Table \\@ref(tab:themes) shows the five broad\nthemes the researchers identified and the more specific repeating ideas\nthat made up each of those themes. In their research report, they\nprovide numerous quotations from their participants, such as this one\nfrom \"Destiny:\"\n\n> Well, just recently my apartment was broken into and the fact that his\n> Medicaid for some reason was cancelled so a lot of things was\n> happening within the last two weeks all at one time. So that in itself\n> I don't want to say almost drove me mad but it put me in a\n> funk....Like I really was depressed. (p. 357)\n\nTheir theoretical narrative focused on the participants' experience of\ntheir symptoms not as an abstract \"affective disorder\" but as closely\ntied to the daily struggle of raising children alone under often\ndifficult circumstances.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nTable: Themes and repeating ideas in a study of postpartum depression among low-income mothers.\n\n|Theme               |Repeating ideas                                                               |\n|:-------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|Ambivalence         |“I wasn’t prepared for this baby,” “I didn’t want to have any more children.” |\n|Caregiving overload |“Please stop crying,” “I need a break,” “I can’t do this anymore.”            |\n|Juggling            |“No time to breathe,” “Everyone depends on me,” “Navigating the maze.”        |\n|Mothering alone     |“I really don’t have any help,” “My baby has no father.”                      |\n|Real-life worry     |“I don’t have any money,” “Will my baby be OK?” “It’s not safe here.”         |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### The Quantitative-Qualitative \"Debate\" {.unnumbered}\n\nGiven their differences, it may come as no surprise that quantitative\nand qualitative research in psychology and related fields do not coexist\nin complete harmony. Some quantitative researchers criticize qualitative\nmethods on the grounds that they lack objectivity, are difficult to\nevaluate in terms of reliability and validity, and do not allow\ngeneralization to people or situations other than those actually\nstudied. At the same time, some qualitative researchers criticize\nquantitative methods on the grounds that they overlook the richness of\nhuman behavior and experience and instead answer simple questions about\neasily quantifiable variables.\n\nIn general, however, qualitative researchers are well aware of the\nissues of objectivity, reliability, validity, and generalizability. In\nfact, they have developed a number of frameworks for addressing these\nissues (which are beyond the scope of our discussion). And in general,\nquantitative researchers are well aware of the issue of\noversimplification. They do not believe that all human behavior and\nexperience can be adequately described in terms of a small number of\nvariables and the statistical relationships among them. Instead, they\nuse simplification as a strategy for uncovering general principles of\nhuman behavior.\n\nMany researchers from both the quantitative and qualitative camps now\nagree that the two approaches can and should be combined into what has\ncome to be called [mixed-methods research] [@todd2004mixing]. (In fact,\nthe studies by Lindqvist and colleagues and by Abrams and Curran both\ncombined quantitative and qualitative approaches.) One approach to\ncombining quantitative and qualitative research is to use qualitative\nresearch for hypothesis generation and quantitative research for\nhypothesis testing. Again, while a qualitative study might suggest that\nfamilies who experience an unexpected suicide have more difficulty\nresolving the question of why, a well-designed quantitative study could\ntest a hypothesis by measuring these specific variables for a large\nsample. A second approach to combining quantitative and qualitative\nresearch is referred to as [triangulation]. The idea is to use both\nquantitative and qualitative methods simultaneously to study the same\ngeneral questions and to compare the results. If the results of the\nquantitative and qualitative methods converge on the same general\nconclusion, they reinforce and enrich each other. If the results\ndiverge, then they suggest an interesting new question: Why do the\nresults diverge and how can they be reconciled?\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   Qualitative research is an important alternative to quantitative\n    research in psychology. It generally involves asking broader\n    research questions, collecting more detailed data (e.g.,\n    interviews), and using nonstatistical analyses.\n-   Many researchers conceptualize quantitative and qualitative research\n    as complementary and advocate combining them. For example,\n    qualitative research can be used to generate hypotheses and\n    quantitative research to test them.\n:::\n\n::: exercises\n##### EXERCISE {.unnumbered}\n\n1.
