Yet coming up\nwith good research questions is something that novice researchers often\nfind difficult and stressful. One reason is that this is a creative\nprocess that can appear mysterious---even magical---with experienced\nresearchers seeming to pull interesting research questions out of thin\nair. However, psychological research on creativity has shown that it is\nneither as mysterious nor as magical as it appears. It is largely the\nproduct of ordinary thinking strategies and persistence\n[@weisberg1993creativity]. This section covers some fairly simple\nstrategies for finding general research ideas, turning those ideas into\nempirically testable research questions, and finally evaluating those\nquestions in terms of how interesting they are and how feasible they\nwould be to answer.\n\n### Finding Inspiration {.unnumbered}\n\nResearch questions often begin as more general research ideas---usually\nfocusing on some behavior or psychological characteristic:\ntalkativeness, memory for touches, depression, bungee jumping, and so\non. Before looking at how to turn such ideas into empirically testable\nresearch questions, it is worth looking at where such ideas come from in\nthe first place. Three of the most common sources of inspiration are\ninformal observations, practical problems, and previous research.\n\nInformal observations include direct observations of our own and others'\nbehavior as well as secondhand observations from nonscientific sources\nsuch as newspapers, books, and so on. For example, you might notice that\nyou always seem to be in the slowest moving line at the grocery store.\nCould it be that most people think the same thing? Or you might read in\nthe local newspaper about people donating money and food to a local\nfamily whose house has burned down and begin to wonder about who makes\nsuch donations and why. Some of the most famous research in psychology\nhas been inspired by informal observations. Stanley Milgram's famous\nresearch on obedience, for example, was inspired in part by journalistic\nreports of the trials of accused Nazi war criminals---many of whom\nclaimed that they were only obeying orders. This led him to wonder about\nthe extent to which ordinary people will commit immoral acts simply\nbecause they are ordered to do so by an authority figure\n[@milgram1963behavioral].\n\nPractical problems can also inspire research ideas, leading directly to\napplied research in such domains as law, health, education, and sports.\nCan human figure drawings help children remember details about being\nphysically or sexually abused? How effective is psychotherapy for\ndepression compared to drug therapy? To what extent do cell phones\nimpair people's driving ability? How can we teach children to read more\nefficiently? What is the best mental preparation for running a marathon?\n\nProbably the most common inspiration for new research ideas, however, is\nprevious research. Recall that science is a kind of large-scale\ncollaboration in which many different researchers read and evaluate each\nother's work and conduct new studies to build on it. Of course,\nexperienced researchers are familiar with previous research in their\narea of expertise and probably have a long list of ideas. This suggests\nthat novice researchers can find inspiration by consulting with a more\nexperienced researcher (e.g., students can consult a faculty member).\nBut they can also find inspiration by picking up a copy of almost any\nprofessional journal and reading the titles and abstracts. In one\ntypical issue of *Psychological Science*, for example, you can find\narticles on the perception of shapes, anti-Semitism, police lineups, the\nmeaning of death, second-language learning, people who seek negative\nemotional experiences, and many other topics. If you can narrow your\ninterests down to a particular topic (e.g., memory) or domain (e.g.,\nhealth care), you can also look through more specific journals, such as\n*Memory & Cognition* or *Health Psychology*.\n\n### Generating Empirically Testable Research Questions {.unnumbered}\n\nOnce you have a research idea, you need to use it to generate one or\nmore empirically testable research questions, that is, questions\nexpressed in terms of a single variable or relationship between\nvariables. One way to do this is to look closely at the discussion\nsection in a recent research article on the topic. This is the last\nmajor section of the article, in which the researchers summarize their\nresults, interpret them in the context of past research, and suggest\ndirections for future research. These suggestions often take the form of\nspecific research questions, which you can then try to answer with\nadditional research. This can be a good strategy because it is likely\nthat the suggested questions have already been identified as interesting\nand important by experienced researchers.\n\nBut you may also want to generate your own research questions. How can\nyou do this? First, if you have a particular behavior or psychological\ncharacteristic in mind, you can simply conceptualize it as a variable\nand ask how frequent or intense it is. How many words on average do\npeople speak per day? How accurate are children's memories of being\ntouched? What percentage of people have sought professional help for\ndepression? If the question has never been studied\nscientifically---which is something that you will learn in your\nliterature review---then it might be interesting and worth pursuing.\n\nIf scientific research has already answered the question of how frequent\nor intense the behavior or characteristic is, then you should consider\nturning it into a question about a statistical relationship between that\nbehavior or characteristic and some other variable. One way to do this\nis to ask yourself the following series of more general questions and\nwrite down all the answers you can think of.\n\n-   What are some possible causes of the behavior or characteristic?\n-   What are some possible effects of the behavior or characteristic?\n-   What types of people might exhibit more or less of the behavior or\n    characteristic?\n-   What types of situations might elicit more or less of the behavior\n    or characteristic?\n\nIn general, each answer you write down can be conceptualized as a second\nvariable, suggesting a question about a statistical relationship. If you\nwere interested in talkativeness, for example, it might occur to you\nthat a possible cause of this psychological characteristic is family\nsize. Is there a statistical relationship between family size and\ntalkativeness? Or it might occur to you that people seem to be more\ntalkative in same-sex groups than mixed-sex groups. Is there a\ndifference in the average level of talkativeness of people in same-sex\ngroups and people in mixed-sex groups? This approach should allow you to\ngenerate many different empirically testable questions about almost any\nbehavior or psychological characteristic.\n\nIf through this process you generate a question that has never been\nstudied scientifically---which again is something that you will learn in\nyour literature review---then it might be interesting and worth\npursuing. But what if you find that it *has* been studied\nscientifically? Although novice researchers often want to give up and\nmove on to a new question at this point, this is not necessarily a good\nstrategy. For one thing, the fact that the question has been studied\nscientifically and the research published suggests that it is of\ninterest to the scientific community. For another, the question can\nalmost certainly be refined so that its answer will still contribute\nsomething new to the research literature. Again, asking yourself a\nseries of more general questions about the statistical relationship is a\ngood strategy.\n\n-   Are there other ways to operationally define the variables?\n-   Are there types of people for whom the statistical relationship\n    might be stronger or weaker?\n-   Are there situations in which the statistical relationship might be\n    stronger or weaker---including situations with practical importance?\n\nFor example, research has shown that women and men speak about the same\nnumber of words per day---but this was when talkativeness was measured\nin terms of the number of words spoken per day among college students in\nthe United States and Mexico. We can still ask whether other ways of\nmeasuring talkativeness---perhaps the number of different people spoken\nto each day---produce the same result. Or we can ask whether studying\nelderly people or people from other cultures produces the same result.\nAgain, this approach should help you generate many different research\nquestions about almost any statistical relationship.\n\n### Evaluating Research Questions {.unnumbered}\n\nResearchers usually generate many more research questions than they ever\nattempt to answer. This means they must have some way of evaluating the\nresearch questions they generate so that they can choose which ones to\npursue. In this section, we consider two criteria for evaluating\nresearch questions: the interestingness of the question and the\nfeasibility of answering it.\n\n#### Interestingness {.unnumbered}\n\nHow often do people tie their shoes? Do people feel pain when you punch\nthem in the jaw? Are women more likely to wear makeup than men? Do\npeople prefer vanilla or chocolate ice cream? Although it would be a\nfairly simple matter to design a study and collect data to answer these\nquestions, you probably would not want to because they are not\ninteresting. We are not talking here about whether a research question\nis interesting to us personally but whether it is interesting to people\nmore generally and, especially, to the scientific community. But what\nmakes a research question interesting in this sense? Here we look at\nthree factors that affect the [interestingness] of a research question:\nthe answer is in doubt, the answer fills a gap in the research\nliterature, and the answer has important practical implications.\n\nFirst, a research question is interesting to the extent that its answer\nis in doubt. Obviously, questions that have been answered by scientific\nresearch are no longer interesting as the subject of new empirical\nresearch. But the fact that a question has not been answered by\nscientific research does not necessarily make it interesting. There has\nto be some reasonable chance that the answer to the question will be\nsomething that we did not already know. But how can you assess this\nbefore actually collecting data? One approach is to try to think of\nreasons to expect different answers to the question---especially ones\nthat seem to conflict with common sense. If you can think of reasons to\nexpect at least two different answers, then the question might be\ninteresting. If you can think of reasons to expect only one answer, then\nit probably is not. The question of whether women are more talkative\nthan men is interesting because there are reasons to expect both\nanswers. The existence of the stereotype itself suggests the answer\ncould be yes, but the fact that women's and men's verbal abilities are\nfairly similar suggests the answer could be no. The question of whether\npeople feel pain when you punch them in the jaw is not interesting\nbecause there is absolutely no reason to think that the answer could be\nanything other than a resounding yes.\n\nA second important factor to consider when deciding if a research\nquestion is interesting is whether answering it will fill a gap in the\nresearch literature. Again, this means in part that the question has not\nalready been answered by scientific research. But it also means that the\nquestion is in some sense a natural one for people who are familiar with\nthe research literature. For example, the question of whether human\nfigure drawings can help children recall touch information would be\nlikely to occur to anyone who was familiar with research on the\nunreliability of eyewitness memory (especially in children) and the\nineffectiveness of some alternative interviewing techniques.\n\nA final factor to consider when deciding whether a research question is\ninteresting is whether its answer has important practical implications.\nAgain, the question of whether human figure drawings help children\nrecall information about being touched has important implications for\nhow children are interviewed in physical and sexual abuse cases. The\nquestion of whether cell phone use impairs driving is interesting\nbecause it is relevant to the personal safety of everyone who travels by\ncar and to the debate over whether cell phone use should be restricted\nby law.\n\n#### Feasibility {.unnumbered}\n\nA second important criterion for evaluating research questions is the\n[feasibility] of successfully answering them. There are many factors\nthat affect feasibility, including time, money, equipment and materials,\ntechnical knowledge and skill, and access to research participants.\nClearly, researchers need to take these factors into account so that\nthey do not waste time and effort pursuing research that they cannot\ncomplete successfully.\n\nLooking through a sample of professional journals in psychology will\nreveal many studies that are complicated and difficult to carry out.\nThese include longitudinal designs in which participants are tracked\nover many years, neuroimaging studies in which participants' brain\nactivity is measured while they carry out various mental tasks, and\ncomplex nonexperimental studies involving several variables and\ncomplicated statistical analyses. Keep in mind, though, that such\nresearch tends to be carried out by teams of highly trained researchers\nwhose work is often supported in part by government and private grants.\nKeep in mind also that research does not have to be complicated or\ndifficult to produce interesting and important results. Looking through\na sample of professional journals will also reveal studies that are\nrelatively simple and easy to carry out---perhaps involving a\nconvenience sample of college students and a paper-and-pencil task.\n\nA final point here is that it is generally good practice to use methods\nthat have already been used successfully by other researchers. For\nexample, if you want to manipulate people's moods to make some of them\nhappy, it would be a good idea to use one of the many approaches that\nhave been used successfully by other researchers (e.g., paying them a\ncompliment). This is good not only for the sake of feasibility---the\napproach is \"tried and true\"---but also because it provides greater\ncontinuity with previous research. This makes it easier to compare your\nresults with those of other researchers and to understand the\nimplications of their research for yours, and vice versa.\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   Research ideas can come from a variety of sources, including\n    informal observations, practical problems, and previous research.\n-   Research questions expressed in terms of variables and relationships\n    between variables can be suggested by other researchers or generated\n    by asking a series of more general questions about the behavior or\n    psychological characteristic of interest.\n-   It is important to evaluate how interesting a research question is\n    before designing a study and collecting data to answer it. Factors\n    that affect interestingness are the extent to which the answer is in\n    doubt, whether it fills a gap in the research literature, and\n    whether it has important practical implications.\n-   It is also important to evaluate how feasible a research question\n    will be to answer. Factors that affect feasibility include time,\n    money, technical knowledge and skill, and access to special\n    equipment and research participants.\n:::\n\n::: exercises\n##### EXERCISES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Practice: Generate five research ideas based on each of the\n    following: informal observations, practical problems, and topics\n    discussed in recent issues of professional journals.\n2.  Practice: Generate five empirical research questions about each of\n    the following behaviors or psychological characteristics:\n    long-distance running, getting tattooed, social anxiety, bullying,\n    and memory for early childhood events.\n3.  Practice: Evaluate each of the research questions you generated in\n    Exercise 2 in terms of its interestingness based on the criteria\n    discussed in this section.\n4.  Practice: Find an issue of a journal that publishes short empirical\n    research reports (e.g., *Psychological Science, Psychonomic Bulletin\n    and Review, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin*). Pick three\n    studies, and rate each one in terms of how feasible it would be for\n    you to replicate it with the resources available to you right now.\n    Use the following rating scale: (1) You could replicate it\n    essentially as reported. (2) You could replicate it with some\n    simplifications. (3) You could not replicate it. Explain each\n    rating.\n:::\n\n## Reviewing the Research Literature\n\n::: learningobjectives\n##### LEARNING OBJECTIVES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Define the research literature in psychology and give examples of\n    sources that are part of the research literature and sources that\n    are not.\n2.  Describe and use several methods for finding previous research on a\n    particular research idea or question.\n:::\n\nReviewing the research literature means finding, reading, and\nsummarizing the published research relevant to your question. An\nempirical research report written in American Psychological Association\n(APA) style always includes a written literature review, but it is\nimportant to review the literature early in the research process for\nseveral reasons.\n\n-   It can help you turn a research idea into an interesting research\n    question.\n-   It can tell you if a research question has already been answered.\n-   It can help you evaluate the interestingness of a research question.\n-   It can give you ideas for how to conduct your own study.\n-   It can tell you how your study fits into the research literature.\n\n### What Is the Research Literature? {.unnumbered}\n\nThe [research literature] in any field is all the published research in\nthat field. The research literature in psychology is\nenormous---including millions of scholarly articles and books dating to\nthe beginning of the field---and it continues to grow. Although its\nboundaries are somewhat fuzzy, the research literature definitely does\n*not* include self-help and other pop psychology books, dictionary and\nencyclopedia entries, websites, and similar sources that are intended\nmainly for the general public. These are considered unreliable because\nthey are not reviewed by other researchers and are often based on little\nmore than common sense or personal experience. Wikipedia contains much\nvaluable information, but the fact that its authors are anonymous and\nits content continually changes makes it unsuitable as a basis of sound\nscientific research. For our purposes, it helps to define the research\nliterature as consisting almost entirely of two types of sources:\narticles in professional journals, and scholarly books in psychology and\nrelated fields.\n\n#### Professional Journals {.unnumbered}\n\n[Professional journals](#professional-journal) are periodicals that\npublish original research articles. There are thousands of professional\njournals that publish research in psychology and related fields. They\nare usually published monthly or quarterly in individual issues, each of\nwhich contains several articles. The issues are organized into volumes,\nwhich usually consist of all the issues for a calendar year. Some\njournals are published in hard copy only, others in both hard copy and\nelectronic form, and still others in electronic form only.\n\nMost articles in professional journals are one of two basic types:\nempirical research reports and review articles. [Empirical research\nreports](#empirical-research-report) describe one or more new empirical\nstudies conducted by the authors. They introduce a research question,\nexplain why it is interesting, review previous research, describe their\nmethod and results, and draw their conclusions. [Review\narticles](#review-article) summarize previously published research on a\ntopic and usually present new ways to organize or explain the results.\nWhen a review article is devoted primarily to presenting a new theory,\nit is often referred to as a [theoretical article].\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Small sample of the thousands of professional journals that publish research in psychology and related fields.](images/ideas/journals.jpeg){fig-align='center' width=40%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nMost professional journals in psychology undergo a process of [peer\nreview]. Researchers who want to publish their work in the journal\nsubmit a manuscript to the editor---who is generally an established\nresearcher too---who in turn sends it to two or three experts on the\ntopic. Each reviewer reads the manuscript, writes a critical review, and\nsends the review back to the editor along with his or her\nrecommendations. The editor then decides whether to accept the article\nfor publication, ask the authors to make changes and resubmit it for\nfurther consideration, or reject it outright. In any case, the editor\nforwards the reviewers' written comments to the researchers so that they\ncan revise their manuscript accordingly. Peer review is important\nbecause it ensures that the work meets basic standards of the field\nbefore it can enter the research literature.\n\n#### Scholarly Books {.unnumbered}\n\n[Scholarly books](#scholarly-book) are books written by researchers and\npractitioners mainly for use by other researchers and practitioners. A\n[monograph] is written by a single author or a small group of authors\nand usually gives a coherent presentation of a topic much like an\nextended review article. [Edited volumes](#edited-volume) have an editor\nor a small group of editors who recruit many authors to write separate\nchapters on different aspects of the same topic. Although edited volumes\ncan also give a coherent presentation of the topic, it is not unusual\nfor each chapter to take a different perspective or even for the authors\nof different chapters to openly disagree with each other. In general,\nscholarly books undergo a peer review process similar to that used by\nprofessional journals.\n\n### Literature Search Strategies {.unnumbered}\n\n#### Using PsycINFO and Other Databases {.unnumbered}\n\nThe primary method used to search the research literature involves using\none or more electronic databases. These include Academic Search Premier,\nJSTOR, and ProQuest for all academic disciplines, ERIC for education,\nand PubMed for medicine and related fields. The most important for our\npurposes, however, is [PsycINFO], which is produced by the APA. PsycINFO\nis so comprehensive---covering thousands of professional journals and\nscholarly books going back more than 100 years---that for most purposes\nits content is synonymous with the research literature in psychology.\nLike most such databases, PsycINFO is usually available through your\ncollege or university library.\n\nPsycINFO consists of individual records for each article, book chapter,\nor book in the database. Each record includes basic publication\ninformation, an abstract or summary of the work, and a list of other\nworks cited by that work. A computer interface allows entering one or\nmore search terms and returns any records that contain those search\nterms. (These interfaces are provided by different vendors and therefore\ncan look somewhat different depending on the library you use.) Each\nrecord also contains lists of keywords that describe the content of the\nwork and also a list of index terms. The index terms are especially\nhelpful because they are standardized. Research on differences between\nwomen and men, for example, is always indexed under \"Human Sex\nDifferences.\" Research on touching is always indexed under the term\n\"Physical Contact.\" If you do not know the appropriate index terms,\nPsycINFO includes a thesaurus that can help you find them.\n\nGiven that there are nearly three million records in PsycINFO, you may\nhave to try a variety of search terms in different combinations and at\ndifferent levels of specificity before you find what you are looking\nfor. Imagine, for example, that you are interested in the question of\nwhether women and men differ in terms of their ability to recall\nexperiences from when they were very young. If you were to enter \"memory\nfor early experiences\" as your search term, PsycINFO would return only\nsix records, most of which are not particularly relevant to your\nquestion. However, if you were to enter the search term \"memory,\" it\nwould return 149,777 records---far too many to look through\nindividually. This is where the thesaurus helps. Entering \"memory\" into\nthe thesaurus provides several more specific index terms---one of which\nis \"early memories.\" While searching for \"early memories\" among the\nindex terms returns 1,446 records---still too many too look through\nindividually---combining it with \"human sex differences\" as a second\nsearch term returns 37 articles, many of which are highly relevant to\nthe topic.\n\nDepending on the vendor that provides the interface to PsycINFO, you may\nbe able to save, print, or e-mail the relevant PsycINFO records. The\nrecords might even contain links to full-text copies of the works\nthemselves. (PsycARTICLES is a database that provides full-text access\nto articles in all journals published by the APA.) If not, and you want\na copy of the work, you will have to find out if your library carries\nthe journal or has the book and the hard copy on the library shelves. Be\nsure to ask a librarian if you need help.\n\n#### Using Other Search Techniques {.unnumbered}\n\nIn addition to entering search terms into PsycINFO and other databases,\nthere are several other techniques you can use to search the research\nliterature. First, if you have one good article or book chapter on your\ntopic---a recent review article is best---you can look through the\nreference list of that article for other relevant articles, books, and\nbook chapters. In fact, you should do this with any relevant article or\nbook chapter you find. You can also start with a classic article or book\nchapter on your topic, find its record in PsycINFO (by entering the\nauthor's name or article's title as a search term), and link from there\nto a list of other works in PsycINFO that cite that classic article.\nThis works because other researchers working on your topic are likely to\nbe aware of the classic article and cite it in their own work. You can\nalso do a general Internet search using search terms related to your\ntopic or the name of a researcher who conducts research on your topic.\nThis might lead you directly to works that are part of the research\nliterature (e.g., articles in open-access journals or posted on\nresearchers' own websites). The search engine Google Scholar is\nespecially useful for this purpose. A general Internet search might also\nlead you to websites that are not part of the research literature but\nmight provide references to works that are. Finally, you can talk to\npeople (e.g., your instructor or other faculty members in psychology)\nwho know something about your topic and can suggest relevant articles\nand book chapters.\n\n### What to Search For {.unnumbered}\n\nWhen you do a literature review, you need to be selective. Not every\narticle, book chapter, and book that relates to your research idea or\nquestion will be worth obtaining, reading, and integrating into your\nreview. Instead, you want to focus on sources that help you do four\nbasic things: (a) refine your research question, (b) identify\nappropriate research methods, (c) place your research in the context of\nprevious research, and (d) write an effective research report. Several\nbasic principles can help you find the most useful sources.\n\nFirst, it is best to focus on recent research, keeping in mind that what\ncounts as recent depends on the topic. For newer topics that are\nactively being studied, \"recent\" might mean published in the past year\nor two. For older topics that are receiving less attention right now,\n\"recent\" might mean within the past 10 years. You will get a feel for\nwhat counts as recent for your topic when you start your literature\nsearch. A good general rule, however, is to start with sources published\nin the past five years. The main exception to this rule would be classic\narticles that turn up in the reference list of nearly every other\nsource. If other researchers think that this work is important, even\nthough it is old, then by all means you should include it in your\nreview.\n\nSecond, you should look for review articles on your topic because they\nwill provide a useful overview of it---often discussing important\ndefinitions, results, theories, trends, and controversies---giving you a\ngood sense of where your own research fits into the literature. You\nshould also look for empirical research reports addressing your question\nor similar questions, which can give you ideas about how to\noperationally define your variables and collect your data. As a general\nrule, it is good to use methods that others have already used\nsuccessfully unless you have good reasons not to. Finally, you should\nlook for sources that provide information that can help you argue for\nthe interestingness of your research question. For a study on the\neffects of cell phone use on driving ability, for example, you might\nlook for information about how widespread cell phone use is, how\nfrequent and costly motor vehicle crashes are, and so on.\n\nHow many sources are enough for your literature review? This is a\ndifficult question because it depends on how extensively your topic has\nbeen studied and also on your own goals. One study found that across a\nvariety of professional journals in psychology, the average number of\nsources cited per article was about 50 [@adair2003explosion]. This gives\na rough idea of what professional researchers consider to be adequate.\nAs a student, you might be assigned a much lower minimum number of\nreferences to use, but the principles for selecting the most useful ones\nremain the same.\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   The research literature in psychology is all the published research\n    in psychology, consisting primarily of articles in professional\n    journals and scholarly books.\n-   Early in the research process, it is important to conduct a review\n    of the research literature on your topic to refine your research\n    question, identify appropriate research methods, place your question\n    in the context of other research, and prepare to write an effective\n    research report.\n-   There are several strategies for finding previous research on your\n    topic.
