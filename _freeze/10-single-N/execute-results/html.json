For each\nof several days, the researchers carefully recorded whether or not each\nstudent was doing schoolwork every 10 seconds during a 30-minute period.\nOnce they had established this baseline, they introduced a treatment.\nThe treatment was that when the student was doing schoolwork, the\nteacher gave him or her positive attention in the form of a comment like\n\"good work\" or a pat on the shoulder. The result was that all of the\nstudents dramatically increased their time spent on schoolwork and\ndecreased their disruptive behavior during this treatment phase. For\nexample, a student named Robbie originally spent 25% of his time on\nschoolwork and the other 75% \"snapping rubber bands, playing with toys\nfrom his pocket, and talking and laughing with peers\" (p. 3). During the\ntreatment phase, however, he spent 71% of his time on schoolwork and\nonly 29% on other activities. Finally, when the researchers had the\nteacher stop giving positive attention, the students all decreased their\nstudying and increased their disruptive behavior. This confirmed that it\nwas, in fact, the positive attention that was responsible for the\nincrease in studying. This was one of the first studies to show that\nattending to positive behavior---and ignoring negative behavior---could\nbe a quick and effective way to deal with problem behavior in an applied\nsetting.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Single-subject research has shown that positive attention from a teacher for studying can increase studying and decrease disruptive behavior. *Photo by Jerry Wang on Unsplash.*](images/single-N/teacher.jpeg){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMost of this book is about what can be called group research, which\ntypically involves studying a large number of participants and combining\ntheir data to draw general conclusions about human behavior. The study\nby Hall and his colleagues, in contrast, is an example of single-subject\nresearch, which typically involves studying a small number of\nparticipants and focusing closely on each individual. In this chapter,\nwe consider this alternative approach. We begin with an overview of\nsingle-subject research, including some assumptions on which it is\nbased, who conducts it, and why they do. We then look at some basic\nsingle-subject research designs and how the data from those designs are\nanalyzed. Finally, we consider some of the strengths and weaknesses of\nsingle-subject research as compared with group research and see how\nthese two approaches can complement each other.\n\n## Overview of Single-Subject Research\n\n::: learningobjectives\n##### LEARNING OBJECTIVES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Explain what single-subject research is, including how it differs\n    from other types of psychological research.\n2.  Explain what case studies are, including some of their strengths and\n    weaknesses.\n3.  Explain who uses single-subject research and why.\n:::\n\n### What Is Single-Subject Research? {.unnumbered}\n\n[Single-subject research] is a type of quantitative research that\ninvolves studying in detail the behavior of each of a small number of\nparticipants. Note that the term single-subject does not mean that only\none participant is studied; it is more typical for there to be somewhere\nbetween two and 10 participants. (This is why single-subject research\ndesigns are sometimes called small-n designs, where n is the statistical\nsymbol for the sample size.) Single-subject research can be contrasted\nwith [group research], which typically involves studying large numbers\nof participants and examining their behavior primarily in terms of group\nmeans, standard deviations, and so on. The majority of this book is\ndevoted to understanding group research, which is the most common\napproach in psychology. But single-subject research is an important\nalternative, and it is the primary approach in some areas of psychology.\n\nBefore continuing, it is important to distinguish single-subject\nresearch from two other approaches, both of which involve studying in\ndetail a small number of participants. One is qualitative research,\nwhich focuses on understanding people's subjective experience by\ncollecting relatively unstructured data (e.g., detailed interviews) and\nanalyzing those data using narrative rather than quantitative\ntechniques. Single-subject research, in contrast, focuses on\nunderstanding objective behavior through experimental manipulation and\ncontrol, collecting highly structured data, and analyzing those data\nquantitatively.\n\nIt is also important to distinguish single-subject research from case\nstudies. A [case study] is a detailed description of an individual,\nwhich can include both qualitative and quantitative analyses. (Case\nstudies that include only qualitative analyses can be considered a type\nof qualitative research.) The history of psychology is filled with\ninfluential cases studies, such as Sigmund Freud's description of \"Anna\nO.\" (see box \"The Case of 'Anna O.'\") and John Watson and Rosalie\nRayner's description of Little Albert [@watson1920conditioned] who\nlearned to fear a white rat---along with other furry objects---when the\nresearchers made a loud noise while he was playing with the rat. Case\nstudies can be useful for suggesting new research questions and for\nillustrating general principles. They can also help researchers\nunderstand rare phenomena, such as the effects of damage to a specific\npart of the human brain. As a general rule, however, case studies cannot\nsubstitute for carefully designed group or single-subject research\nstudies. One reason is that case studies usually do not allow\nresearchers to determine whether specific events are causally related,\nor even related at all. For example, if a patient is described in a case\nstudy as having been sexually abused as a child and then as having\ndeveloped an eating disorder as a teenager, there is no way to determine\nwhether these two events had anything to do with each other. A second\nreason is that an individual case can always be unusual in some way and\ntherefore be unrepresentative of people more generally. Thus case\nstudies have serious problems with both internal and external validity.\n\n::: fyi\n##### The Case of \"Anna O.\" {.unnumbered}\n\nSigmund Freud used the case of a young woman he called \"Anna O.\" to\nillustrate many principles of his theory of psychoanalysis\n[@freud1957five]. (Her real name was Bertha Pappenheim, and she was an\nearly feminist who went on to make important contributions to the field\nof social work.) Anna had come to Freud's colleague Josef Breuer around\n1880 with a variety of odd physical and psychological symptoms. One of\nthem was that for several weeks she was unable to drink any fluids.\nAccording to Freud,\n\n> She would take up the glass of water that she longed for, but as soon\n> as it touched her lips she would push it away like someone suffering\n> from hydrophobia....She lived only on fruit, such as melons, etc., so\n> as to lessen her tormenting thirst (p. 9).\n\nBut according to Freud, a breakthrough came one day while Anna was under\nhypnosis.\n\n> \\[S\\]he grumbled about her English \"lady-companion,\" whom she did not\n> care for, and went on to describe, with every sign of disgust, how she\n> had once gone into this lady's room and how her little dog---horrid\n> creature!---had drunk out of a glass there. The patient had said\n> nothing, as she had wanted to be polite. After giving further\n> energetic expression to the anger she had held back, she asked for\n> something to drink, drank a large quantity of water without any\n> difficulty, and awoke from her hypnosis with the glass at her lips;\n> and thereupon the disturbance vanished, never to return.\n\nFreud's interpretation was that Anna had repressed the memory of this\nincident along with the emotion that it triggered and that this was what\nhad caused her inability to drink. Furthermore, her recollection of the\nincident, along with her expression of the emotion she had repressed,\ncaused the symptom to go away.\n\nAs an illustration of Freud's theory, the case study of Anna O. is quite\neffective. As evidence for the theory, however, it is essentially\nworthless. The description provides no way of knowing whether Anna had\nreally repressed the memory of the dog drinking from the glass, whether\nthis repression had caused her inability to drink, or whether recalling\nthis \"trauma\" relieved the symptom. It is also unclear from this case\nstudy how typical or atypical Anna's experience was.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![\"Anna O.\" was the subject of a famous case study used by Freud to illustrate the principles of psychoanalysis.

But\nwhy take this approach instead of the group approach? There are several\nimportant assumptions underlying single-subject research, and it will\nhelp to consider them now.\n\nFirst and foremost is the assumption that it is important to focus\nintensively on the behavior of individual participants. One reason for\nthis is that group research can hide individual differences and generate\nresults that do not represent the behavior of any individual. For\nexample, a treatment that has a positive effect for half the people\nexposed to it but a negative effect for the other half would, on\naverage, appear to have no effect at all. Single-subject research,\nhowever, would likely reveal these individual differences. A second\nreason to focus intensively on individuals is that sometimes it is the\nbehavior of a particular individual that is primarily of interest. A\nschool psychologist, for example, might be interested in changing the\nbehavior of a particular disruptive student. Although previous published\nresearch (both single-subject and group research) is likely to provide\nsome guidance on how to do this, conducting a study on this student\nwould be more direct and probably more effective.\n\nA second assumption of single-subject research is that it is important\nto discover causal relationships through the manipulation of an\nindependent variable, the careful measurement of a dependent variable,\nand the control of extraneous variables. For this reason, single-subject\nresearch is often considered a type of experimental research with good\ninternal validity. Recall, for example, that Hall and his colleagues\nmeasured their dependent variable (studying) many times---first under a\nno-treatment control condition, then under a treatment condition\n(positive teacher attention), and then again under the control\ncondition. Because there was a clear increase in studying when the\ntreatment was introduced, a decrease when it was removed, and an\nincrease when it was reintroduced, there is little doubt that the\ntreatment was the cause of the improvement.\n\nA third assumption of single-subject research is that it is important to\nstudy strong and consistent effects that have biological or social\nimportance. Applied researchers, in particular, are interested in\ntreatments that have substantial effects on important behaviors and that\ncan be implemented reliably in the real-world contexts in which they\noccur. This is sometimes referred to as [social validity]\n[@wolf1978social]. The study by Hall and his colleagues, for example,\nhad good social validity because it showed strong and consistent effects\nof positive teacher attention on a behavior that is of obvious\nimportance to teachers, parents, and students. Furthermore, the teachers\nfound the treatment easy to implement, even in their often chaotic\nelementary school classrooms.\n\n### Who Uses Single-Subject Research? {.unnumbered}\n\nSingle-subject research has been around as long as the field of\npsychology itself. In the late 1800s, one of psychology's founders,\nWilhelm Wundt, studied sensation and consciousness by focusing\nintensively on each of a small number of research participants. Herman\nEbbinghaus's research on memory and Ivan Pavlov's research on classical\nconditioning are other early examples, both of which are still described\nin almost every introductory psychology textbook.\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century, B. F. Skinner clarified many of the\nassumptions underlying single-subject research and refined many of its\ntechniques [@skinner1938behavior]. He and other researchers then used it\nto describe how rewards, punishments, and other external factors affect\nbehavior over time. This work was carried out primarily using nonhuman\nsubjects---mostly rats and pigeons. This approach, which Skinner called\nthe [experimental analysis of behavior]---remains an important subfield\nof psychology and continues to rely almost exclusively on single-subject\nresearch. For excellent examples of this work, look at any issue of the\nJournal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior. By the 1960s, many\nresearchers were interested in using this approach to conduct applied\nresearch primarily with humans---a subfield now called [applied behavior\nanalysis] [@baer1968some]. Applied behavior analysis plays an especially\nimportant role in contemporary research on developmental disabilities,\neducation, organizational behavior, and health, among many other areas.\nExcellent examples of this work (including the study by Hall and his\ncolleagues) can be found in the *Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis*.\n\nAlthough most contemporary single-subject research is conducted from the\nbehavioral perspective, it can in principle be used to address questions\nframed in terms of any theoretical perspective. For example, a studying\ntechnique based on cognitive principles of learning and memory could be\nevaluated by testing it on individual high school students using the\nsingle-subject approach. The single-subject approach can also be used by\nclinicians who take any theoretical perspective---behavioral, cognitive,\npsychodynamic, or humanistic---to study processes of therapeutic change\nwith individual clients and to document their clients' improvement\n[@kazdin2019single].\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   Single-subject research---which involves testing a small number of\n    participants and focusing intensively on the behavior of each\n    individual---is an important alternative to group research in\n    psychology.\n-   Single-subject studies must be distinguished from case studies, in\n    which an individual case is described in detail. Case studies can be\n    useful for generating new research questions, for studying rare\n    phenomena, and for illustrating general principles. However, they\n    cannot substitute for carefully controlled experimental or\n    correlational studies because they are low in internal and external\n    validity.\n-   Single-subject research has been around since the beginning of the\n    field of psychology. Today it is most strongly associated with the\n    behavioral theoretical perspective, but it can in principle be used\n    to study behavior from any perspective.\n:::\n\n::: exercises\n##### EXERCISES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.

Describe the basic elements of a single-subject research design.\n2.  Design simple single-subject studies using reversal and\n    multiple-baseline designs.\n3.  Explain how single-subject research designs address the issue of\n    internal validity.\n4.  Interpret the results of simple single-subject studies based on the\n    visual inspection of graphed data.\n:::\n\n### General Features of Single-Subject Designs {.unnumbered}\n\nBefore looking at any specific single-subject research designs, it will\nbe helpful to consider some features that are common to most of them.\nMany of these features are illustrated in Figure \\@ref(fig:aba), which\nshows the results of a generic single-subject study. First, the\ndependent variable (represented on the y-axis of the graph) is measured\nrepeatedly over time (represented by the x-axis) at regular intervals.\nSecond, the study is divided into distinct phases, and the participant\nis tested under one condition per phase. The conditions are often\ndesignated by capital letters: A, B, C, and so on. Thus Figure\n\\@ref(fig:aba) represents a design in which the participant was tested\nfirst in one condition (A), then tested in another condition (B), and\nfinally retested in the original condition (A). (This is called a\nreversal design and will be discussed in more detail shortly.)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" fig.asp='0.6'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Results of a generic single-subject study illustrating several principles of single-subject research.](10-single-N_files/figure-html/aba-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnother important aspect of single-subject research is that the change\nfrom one condition to the next does not usually occur after a fixed\namount of time or number of observations. Instead, it depends on the\nparticipant's behavior. Specifically, the researcher waits until the\nparticipant's behavior in one condition becomes fairly consistent from\nobservation to observation before changing conditions. This is sometimes\nreferred to as the [steady state strategy] [@sidman1960tactics]. The\nidea is that when the dependent variable has reached a steady state,\nthen any change across conditions will be relatively easy to detect.\nRecall that we encountered this same principle when discussing\nexperimental research more generally. The effect of an independent\nvariable is easier to detect when the \"noise\" in the data is minimized.\n\n### Reversal Designs {.unnumbered}\n\nThe most basic single-subject research design is the [reversal design],\nalso called the [ABA design]. During the first phase, A, a [baseline] is\nestablished for the dependent variable. This is the level of responding\nbefore any treatment is introduced, and therefore the baseline phase is\na kind of control condition. When steady state responding is reached,\nphase B begins as the researcher introduces the treatment. There may be\na period of adjustment to the treatment during which the behavior of\ninterest becomes more variable and begins to increase or decrease.\nAgain, the researcher waits until that dependent variable reaches a\nsteady state so that it is clear whether and how much it has changed.\nFinally, the researcher removes the treatment and again waits until the\ndependent variable reaches a steady state. This basic reversal design\ncan also be extended with the reintroduction of the treatment (ABAB),\nanother return to baseline (ABABA), and so on.\n\nThe study by Hall and his colleagues was an ABAB reversal design. Figure\n\\@ref(fig:abab) approximates the data for Robbie. The percentage of time\nhe spent studying (the dependent variable) was low during the first\nbaseline phase, increased during the first treatment phase until it\nleveled off, decreased during the second baseline phase, and again\nincreased during the second treatment phase.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" fig.asp='0.6'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![An approximation of the results for Hall and colleagues’ participant Robbie in their ABAB reversal design.](10-single-N_files/figure-html/abab-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhy is the reversal---the removal of the treatment---considered to be\nnecessary in this type of design? Why use an ABA design, for example,\nrather than a simpler AB design? Notice that an AB design is essentially\nan interrupted time-series design applied to an individual participant.\nRecall that one problem with that design is that if the dependent\nvariable changes after the treatment is introduced, it is not always\nclear that the treatment was responsible for the change. It is possible\nthat something else changed at around the same time and that this\nextraneous variable is responsible for the change in the dependent\nvariable. But if the dependent variable changes with the introduction of\nthe treatment and then changes *back* with the removal of the treatment,\nit is much clearer that the treatment (and removal of the treatment) is\nthe cause. In other words, the reversal greatly increases the internal\nvalidity of the study.\n\nThere are close relatives of the basic reversal design that allow for\nthe evaluation of more than one treatment. In a [multiple-treatment\nreversal design], a baseline phase is followed by separate phases in\nwhich different treatments are introduced. For example, a researcher\nmight establish a baseline of studying behavior for a disruptive student\n(A), then introduce a treatment involving positive attention from the\nteacher (B), and then switch to a treatment involving mild punishment\nfor not studying (C). The participant could then be returned to a\nbaseline phase before reintroducing each treatment---perhaps in the\nreverse order as a way of controlling for carryover effects. This\nparticular multiple-treatment reversal design could also be referred to\nas an ABCACB design.\n\nIn an [alternating treatments design], two or more treatments are\nalternated relatively quickly on a regular schedule. For example,\npositive attention for studying could be used one day and mild\npunishment for not studying the next, and so on. Or one treatment could\nbe implemented in the morning and another in the afternoon. The\nalternating treatments design can be a quick and effective way of\ncomparing treatments, but only when the treatments are fast acting.\n\n### Multiple-Baseline Designs {.unnumbered}\n\nThere are two potential problems with the reversal design---both of\nwhich have to do with the removal of the treatment. One is that if a\ntreatment is working, it may be unethical to remove it. For example, if\na treatment seemed to reduce the incidence of self-injury in a\ndevelopmentally disabled child, it would be unethical to remove that\ntreatment just to show that the incidence of self-injury increases. The\nsecond problem is that the dependent variable may not return to baseline\nwhen the treatment is removed. For example, when positive attention for\nstudying is removed, a student might continue to study at an increased\nrate. This could mean that the positive attention had a lasting effect\non the student's studying, which of course would be good. But it could\nalso mean that the positive attention was not really the cause of the\nincreased studying in the first place. Perhaps something else happened\nat about the same time as the treatment---for example, the student's\nparents might have started rewarding him for good grades.\n\nOne solution to these problems is to use a [multiple-baseline design],\nwhich is represented in Figure \\@ref(fig:multiple). In one version of\nthe design, a baseline is established for each of several participants,\nand the treatment is then introduced for each one. In essence, each\nparticipant is tested in an AB design. The key to this design is that\nthe treatment is introduced at a different time for each participant.\nThe idea is that if the dependent variable changes when the treatment is\nintroduced for one participant, it might be a coincidence. But if the\ndependent variable changes when the treatment is introduced for multiple\nparticipants---especially when the treatment is introduced at different\ntimes for the different participants---then it is extremely unlikely to\nbe a coincidence.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" fig.asp='0.4'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Results of a generic multiple-baseline study.

The treatment is introduced at a different time on each baseline.](10-single-N_files/figure-html/multiple-3.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs an example, consider a study by Scott Ross and Robert Horner\n[@ross2009bully]. They were interested in how a school-wide bullying\nprevention program affected the bullying behavior of particular problem\nstudents. At each of three different schools, the researchers studied\ntwo students who had regularly engaged in bullying. During the baseline\nphase, they observed the students for 10-minute periods each day during\nlunch recess and counted the number of aggressive behaviors they\nexhibited toward their peers. (The researchers used handheld computers\nto help record the data.) After 2 weeks, they implemented the program at\none school. After 2 more weeks, they implemented it at the second\nschool. And after 2 more weeks, they implemented it at the third school.\nThey found that the number of aggressive behaviors exhibited by each\nstudent dropped shortly after the program was implemented at his or her\nschool. Notice that if the researchers had only studied one school or if\nthey had introduced the treatment at the same time at all three schools,\nthen it would be unclear whether the reduction in aggressive behaviors\nwas due to the bullying program or something else that happened at about\nthe same time it was introduced (e.g., a holiday, a television program,\na change in the weather). But with their multiple-baseline design, this\nkind of coincidence would have to happen three separate times---a very\nunlikely occurrence---to explain their results.\n\nIn another version of the multiple-baseline design, multiple baselines\nare established for the same participant but for different dependent\nvariables, and the treatment is introduced at a different time for each\ndependent variable. Imagine, for example, a study on the effect of\nsetting clear goals on the productivity of an office worker who has two\nprimary tasks: making sales calls and writing reports. Baselines for\nboth tasks could be established. For example, the researcher could\nmeasure the number of sales calls made and reports written by the worker\neach week for several weeks. Then the goal-setting treatment could be\nintroduced for one of these tasks, and at a later time the same\ntreatment could be introduced for the other task. The logic is the same\nas before. If productivity increases on one task after the treatment is\nintroduced, it is unclear whether the treatment caused the increase. But\nif productivity increases on both tasks after the treatment is\nintroduced---especially when the treatment is introduced at two\ndifferent times---then it seems much clearer that the treatment was\nresponsible.\n\nIn yet a third version of the multiple-baseline design, multiple\nbaselines are established for the same participant but in different\nsettings. For example, a baseline might be established for the amount of\ntime a child spends reading during his free time at school and during\nhis free time at home. Then a treatment such as positive attention might\nbe introduced first at school and later at home. Again, if the dependent\nvariable changes after the treatment is introduced in each setting, then\nthis gives the researcher confidence that the treatment is, in fact,\nresponsible for the change.\n\n### Data Analysis in Single-Subject Research {.unnumbered}\n\nIn addition to its focus on individual participants, single-subject\nresearch differs from group research in the way the data are typically\nanalyzed. As we have seen throughout the book, group research involves\ncombining data across participants. Group data are described using\nstatistics such as means, standard deviations, Pearson's r, and so on to\ndetect general patterns. Finally, inferential statistics are used to\nhelp decide whether the result for the sample is likely to generalize to\nthe population. Single-subject research, by contrast, relies heavily on\na very different approach called [visual inspection]. This means\nplotting individual participants' data as shown throughout this chapter,\nlooking carefully at those data, and making judgments about whether and\nto what extent the independent variable had an effect on the dependent\nvariable. Inferential statistics are typically not used.\n\nIn visually inspecting their data, single-subject researchers take\nseveral factors into account. One of them is changes in the [level] of\nthe dependent variable from condition to condition. If the dependent\nvariable is much higher or much lower in one condition than another,\nthis suggests that the treatment had an effect. A second factor is\n[trend], which refers to gradual increases or decreases in the dependent\nvariable across observations. If the dependent variable begins\nincreasing or decreasing with a change in conditions, then again this\nsuggests that the treatment had an effect. It can be especially telling\nwhen a trend changes directions---for example, when an unwanted behavior\nis increasing during baseline but then begins to decrease with the\nintroduction of the treatment. A third factor is [latency], which is the\ntime it takes for the dependent variable to begin changing after a\nchange in conditions. In general, if a change in the dependent variable\nbegins shortly after a change in conditions, this suggests that the\ntreatment was responsible.\n\nIn the top panel of Figure \\@ref(fig:aba2), there are fairly obvious\nchanges in the level and trend of the dependent variable from condition\nto condition. Furthermore, the latencies of these changes are short; the\nchange happens immediately. This pattern of results strongly suggests\nthat the treatment was responsible for the changes in the dependent\nvariable. In the bottom panel of Figure \\@ref(fig:aba2), however, the\nchanges in level are fairly small. And although there appears to be an\nincreasing trend in the treatment condition, it looks as though it might\nbe a continuation of a trend that had already begun during baseline.\nThis pattern of results strongly suggests that the treatment was not\nresponsible for any changes in the dependent variable---at least not to\nthe extent that single-subject researchers typically hope to see.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" fig.asp='0.5'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Visual inspection of the data suggests an effective treatment in the top panel but an ineffective treatment in the bottom panel.](10-single-N_files/figure-html/aba2-1.png){fig-align='center' width=60%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Visual inspection of the data suggests an effective treatment in the top panel but an ineffective treatment in the bottom panel.](10-single-N_files/figure-html/aba2-2.png){fig-align='center' width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe results of single-subject research can also be analyzed using\nstatistical procedures---and this is becoming more common. There are\nmany different approaches, and single-subject researchers continue to\ndebate which are the most useful. One approach parallels what is\ntypically done in group research. The mean and standard deviation of\neach participant's responses under each condition are computed and\ncompared, and inferential statistical tests such as the t test or\nanalysis of variance are applied [@fisch2001evaluating]. (Note that\naveraging across participants is less common.) Another approach is to\ncompute the [percentage of nonoverlapping data] (PND) for each\nparticipant [@scruggs2021summarize]. This is the percentage of responses\nin the treatment condition that are more extreme than the most extreme\nresponse in a relevant control condition. In the study of Hall and his\ncolleagues, for example, all measures of Robbie's study time in the\nfirst treatment condition were greater than the highest measure in the\nfirst baseline, for a PND of 100%. The greater the percentage of\nnonoverlapping data, the stronger the treatment effect. Still, formal\nstatistical approaches to data analysis in single-subject research are\ngenerally considered a supplement to visual inspection, not a\nreplacement for it.\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   Single-subject research designs typically involve measuring the\n    dependent variable repeatedly over time and changing conditions\n    (e.g., from baseline to treatment) when the dependent variable has\n    reached a steady state. This approach allows the researcher to see\n    whether changes in the independent variable are causing changes in\n    the dependent variable.\n-   In a reversal design, the participant is tested in a baseline\n    condition, then tested in a treatment condition, and then returned\n    to baseline. If the dependent variable changes with the introduction\n    of the treatment and then changes back with the return to baseline,\n    this provides strong evidence of a treatment effect.\n-   In a multiple-baseline design, baselines are established for\n    different participants, different dependent variables, or different\n    settings---and the treatment is introduced at a different time on\n    each baseline. If the introduction of the treatment is followed by a\n    change in the dependent variable on each baseline, this provides\n    strong evidence of a treatment effect.\n-   Single-subject researchers typically analyze their data by graphing\n    them and making judgments about whether the independent variable is\n    affecting the dependent variable based on level, trend, and latency.\n:::\n\n::: exercises\n##### EXERCISES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.

Explain some of the points of disagreement between advocates of\n    single-subject research and advocates of group research.\n2.  Identify several situations in which single-subject research would\n    be appropriate and several others in which group research would be\n    appropriate.\n:::\n\nSingle-subject research is similar to group research---especially\nexperimental group research---in many ways. They are both quantitative\napproaches that try to establish causal relationships by manipulating an\nindependent variable, measuring a dependent variable, and controlling\nextraneous variables. But there are important differences between these\napproaches too, and these differences sometimes lead to disagreements.\nIt is worth addressing the most common points of disagreement between\nsingle-subject researchers and group researchers and how these\ndisagreements can be resolved. As we will see, single-subject research\nand group research are probably best conceptualized as complementary\napproaches.\n\n### Data Analysis {.unnumbered}\n\nOne set of disagreements revolves around the issue of data analysis.\nSome advocates of group research worry that visual inspection is\ninadequate for deciding whether and to what extent a treatment has\naffected a dependent variable. One specific concern is that visual\ninspection is not sensitive enough to detect weak effects. A second is\nthat visual inspection can be unreliable, with different researchers\nreaching different conclusions about the same set of data\n[@danov2008survey]. A third is that the results of visual\ninspection---an overall judgment of whether or not a treatment was\neffective---cannot be clearly and efficiently summarized or compared\nacross studies (unlike the measures of relationship strength typically\nused in group research).\n\nIn general, single-subject researchers share these concerns. However,\nthey also argue that their use of the steady state strategy, combined\nwith their focus on strong and consistent effects, minimizes most of\nthem. If the effect of a treatment is difficult to detect by visual\ninspection because the effect is weak or the data are noisy, then\nsingle-subject researchers look for ways to increase the strength of the\neffect or reduce the noise in the data by controlling extraneous\nvariables (e.g., by administering the treatment more consistently). If\nthe effect is still difficult to detect, then they are likely to\nconsider it neither strong enough nor consistent enough to be of further\ninterest. Many single-subject researchers also point out that\nstatistical analysis is becoming increasingly common and that many of\nthem are using it as a supplement to visual inspection---especially for\nthe purpose of comparing results across studies [@scruggs2021summarize].\n\nTurning the tables, some advocates of single-subject research worry\nabout the way that group researchers analyze their data. Specifically,\nthey point out that focusing on group means can be highly misleading.\nAgain, imagine that a treatment has a strong positive effect on half the\npeople exposed to it and an equally strong negative effect on the other\nhalf. In a traditional between-subjects experiment, the positive effect\non half the participants in the treatment condition would be\nstatistically cancelled out by the negative effect on the other half.\nThe mean for the treatment group would then be the same as the mean for\nthe control group, making it seem as though the treatment had no effect\nwhen in fact it had a strong effect on every single participant!\n\nBut again, group researchers share this concern. Although they do focus\non group statistics, they also emphasize the importance of examining\ndistributions of individual scores. For example, if some participants\nwere positively affected by a treatment and others negatively affected\nby it, this would produce a bimodal distribution of scores and could be\ndetected by looking at a histogram of the data. The use of\nwithin-subjects designs is another strategy that allows group\nresearchers to observe effects at the individual level and even to\nspecify what percentage of individuals exhibit strong, medium, weak, and\neven negative effects.\n\n### External Validity {.unnumbered}\n\nThe second issue about which single-subject and group researchers\nsometimes disagree has to do with external validity---the ability to\ngeneralize the results of a study beyond the people and situation\nactually studied. In particular, advocates of group research point out\nthe difficulty in knowing whether results for just a few participants\nare likely to generalize to others in the population. Imagine, for\nexample, that in a single-subject study, a treatment has been shown to\nreduce self-injury for each of two developmentally disabled children.\nEven if the effect is strong for these two children, how can one know\nwhether this treatment is likely to work for other developmentally\ndisabled children?\n\nAgain, single-subject researchers share this concern. In response, they\nnote that the strong and consistent effects they are typically\ninterested in---even when observed in small samples---are likely to\ngeneralize to others in the population. Single-subject researchers also\nnote that they place a strong emphasis on replicating their research\nresults. When they observe an effect with a small sample of\nparticipants, they typically try to replicate it with another small\nsample---perhaps with a slightly different type of participant or under\nslightly different conditions. Each time they observe similar results,\nthey rightfully become more confident in the generality of those\nresults. Single-subject researchers can also point to the fact that the\nprinciples of classical and operant conditioning---most of which were\ndiscovered using the single-subject approach---have been successfully\ngeneralized across an incredibly wide range of species and situations.\n\nAnd again turning the tables, single-subject researchers have concerns\nof their own about the external validity of group research. One\nextremely important point they make is that studying large groups of\nparticipants does not entirely solve the problem of generalizing to\nother *individuals.* Imagine, for example, a treatment that has been\nshown to have a small positive effect on average in a large group study.\nIt is likely that although many participants exhibited a small positive\neffect, others exhibited a large positive effect, and still others\nexhibited a small negative effect. When it comes to applying this\ntreatment to another large *group*, we can be fairly sure that it will\nhave a small effect on average. But when it comes to applying this\ntreatment to another *individual*, we cannot be sure whether it will\nhave a small, a large, or even a negative effect. Another point that\nsingle-subject researchers make is that group researchers also face a\nsimilar problem when they study a single situation and then generalize\ntheir results to other situations. For example, researchers who conduct\na study on the effect of cell phone use on drivers on a closed oval\ntrack probably want to apply their results to drivers in many other\nreal-world driving situations. But notice that this requires\ngeneralizing from a single situation to a population of situations. Thus\nthe ability to generalize is based on much more than just the sheer\nnumber of participants one has studied. It requires a careful\nconsideration of the similarity of the participants and situations\nstudied to the population of participants and situations that one wants\nto generalize to [@shadish2002experimental].\n\n### Single-Subject and Group Research as Complementary Methods {.unnumbered}\n\nAs with quantitative and qualitative research, it is probably best to\nconceptualize single-subject research and group research as\ncomplementary methods that have different strengths and weaknesses and\nthat are appropriate for answering different kinds of research questions\n[@kazdin2019single]. Single-subject research is particularly good for\ntesting the effectiveness of treatments on individuals when the focus is\non strong, consistent, and biologically or socially important effects.\nIt is especially useful when the behavior of particular individuals is\nof interest. Clinicians who work with only one individual at a time may\nfind that it is their only option for doing systematic quantitative\nresearch.\n\nGroup research, on the other hand, is good for testing the effectiveness\nof treatments at the group level. Among the advantages of this approach\nis that it allows researchers to detect weak effects, which can be of\ninterest for many reasons. For example, finding a weak treatment effect\nmight lead to refinements of the treatment that eventually produce a\nlarger and more meaningful effect. Group research is also good for\nstudying interactions between treatments and participant\ncharacteristics. For example, if a treatment is effective for those who\nare high in motivation to change and ineffective for those who are low\nin motivation to change, then a group design can detect this much more\nefficiently than a single-subject design. Group research is also\nnecessary to answer questions that cannot be addressed using the\nsingle-subject approach, including questions about independent variables\nthat cannot be manipulated (e.g., number of siblings, extroversion,\nculture).\n\nFinally, it is important to understand that the single-subject and group\napproaches represent different research traditions. This factor is\nprobably the most important one affecting which approach a researcher\nuses. Researchers in the experimental analysis of behavior and applied\nbehavior analysis learn to conceptualize their research questions in\nways that are amenable to the single-subject approach. Researchers in\nmost other areas of psychology learn to conceptualize their research\nquestions in ways that are amenable to the group approach. At the same\ntime, there are many topics in psychology in which research from the two\ntraditions have informed each other and been successfully integrated.\nOne example is research suggesting that both animals and humans have an\ninnate \"number sense\"---an awareness of how many objects or events of a\nparticular type have they have experienced without actually having to\ncount them [@dehaene2011number]. Single-subject research with rats and\nbirds and group research with human infants have shown strikingly\nsimilar abilities in those populations to discriminate small numbers of\nobjects and events. This number sense---which probably evolved long\nbefore humans did---may even be the foundation of humans' advanced\nmathematical abilities.\n\n::: takeaways\n##### KEY TAKEAWAYS {.unnumbered}\n\n-   Differences between single-subject research and group research\n    sometimes lead to disagreements between single-subject and group\n    researchers. These disagreements center on the issues of data\n    analysis and external validity (especially generalization to other\n    people).\n-   Single-subject research and group research are probably best seen as\n    complementary methods, with different strengths and weaknesses, that\n    are appropriate for answering different kinds of research questions.\n:::\n\n::: exercises\n##### EXERCISES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.
